* Now talking in #cos-dev
* Xavier has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
<_Xavier_> *sigh*
* _Xavier_ is now known as Xavier
-> *nickserv* identify BCCF5005
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> yarr!
<Xavier> wb to me *kicks Linksys inna nutz*
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> O_O
<Taos> Owie, yoru gonna hurt Cisco if you do that too hard
<Xavier> can't hurt their stock anymroe than its already hurt...
<Taos> lol
* Sirius has joined #cos-dev
<Xavier> Dogstar!
<Sirius> Hi :)
* CSR-Des has joined #cos-dev
<CSR-Des> any mt IN HERE?
<Darkhorse> uh
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> no
<Darkhorse> ...no.
<Xavier> no
<CSR-Des> hehe sry about that 
* CSR-Des has left #cos-dev
<Xavier> hmm
<Xavier> stupid Chanserv
<Taos> oops, guess I forgot to add the pass when I reregistered
<Xavier> :p
<Sirius> does /names work on this IRC server?
<Xavier> *shrug*
<Sirius> it doesn't seem to for me, but then I know IRC commands like the back of a hand I've never seen before
* Taos sets mode: +k 2510fac81
<Taos> that's better
<Xavier> Sirius: lol
* Taos changes topic to 'See topic titled "Dev IRC channel" in programmers forum for key to join channel'
<Sirius> hmm
<Xavier> reminds me, I need to get you SVN access Siruis
<Sirius> ah
<Xavier> *Sirius
<Sirius> What is SVN anyway?
<Xavier> revision control system
<Sirius> ah
<Xavier> if you are familiar with ClearCase or RCS or CVS or Perforce or StarTeam
<Sirius> similar to CVS?
<Sirius> oh, right
<Xavier> "a better CVS" is their billing ;)
<Sirius> I'm not really FAMILIAR with CVS, I just know what it does and more or less how it works :)
<Sirius> never used it personally because I haven't done large enough group projects before
<Xavier> it's painless with TortoiseSVN
<Sirius> right
<Xavier> in fact, I don't necessarily require the modellers to use it, now that SVN supports read/write access 
  via DAV to the repository
<Sirius> you know, it seems to me the coolest thing about object-oriented design is the 'huh?' factor from people 
  who don't understand it
<Xavier> so it's as simple as mounting a "Web Folder" in Explorer and cut-n-paste between windows
<Sirius> ah, right
<Xavier> lol
<Xavier> problem with that is (1) no log comments to the commit, and (2) it causes a new commit for each file 
  committed
<Taos> the most irritating thing about OO design is the activists that are always trying to force the idea that 
  you must write all your code completely OO. I like to use a lot of OO but not religiously, sometimes the 
  performance tradeoff isn't worth it
<Sirius> (about comment above, it's mainly the vast reserves of terminology that is unbelievably abstract)
<Xavier> most OO design patterns have no real performance penalty
<Taos> yes, but some OO aproaches can not be done without abstraction
<Sirius> I think Java makes people think differently from the rest of the world. Although C# seems much the same 
  from all these online resources
<Taos> well, depending entirely on the prject of course
<Sirius> yeah
<Sirius> AFAIK in C++ you just don't want to make EVERYTHING OO
<Sirius> ...because it doesn't need to be
<Xavier> right
<Sirius> is C# much faster than Java by the way? I haven't really looked up many comparisons yet
<Xavier> I think so
<Xavier> on Windows anyway
<Sirius> ah
<Sirius> The .NET SDK documentation was saying something along the lines of being designed to escape the 
  performance penalty usually associated with managed execution environments
<Sirius> as far as I can tell, C# doesn't really come without .NET either
<Xavier> it's a CLR language
<Xavier> so it has to have it
<Sirius> but it's not always easy to find the information you're looking for on these things
<Sirius> ah
<Xavier> or some other .NET implementation anyway
<Sirius> is it really cross-platform then?
<Xavier> yup
<Xavier> just as much as Java
<Sirius> Microsoft HAS .NET for Unix/Mac?
<Xavier> anywhere that Mono or another .NET implementation runs, C#and VB.NET will run
<Taos> not entirely natively, but with some help it is just as portable as java
<Sirius> right
<Xavier> even J#
* Thoth has joined #cos-dev
<Xavier> they all compile to bytecode like Java
<Thoth> hiya
<Xavier> 'lo Thoth
<Taos> Mono is an implimentation of the .net VM
<Xavier> there are a few others
<Sirius> it's just been my experience that ... well ... Microsoft will do anything in their power not to support 
  anything but Windows :) But they may be changing a bit
<Xavier> Mono seems the most aggressively developed
<Xavier> I think that they had to give .NET over to ECMA to avoid any more Java lawsuits
<Sirius> So J# is essentially Java with .NET?
<Sirius> ah
<Xavier> C# basically was Java
<Xavier> the language pretty much is
<Sirius> Yeah, C# doesn't have that many differences from what I can see
<Xavier> but once they gave .NET to ECMA it became fair game anywhere
<Sirius> I don't know whether or not you can do the two-million-import trick though
<Xavier> lol
<Xavier> probably
<Sirius> seems using is a one-use directive?
<Sirius> oh
<Sirius> wait, probably only using namespace
<Xavier> right
<Sirius> probably more like Java's package directive then
<Taos> I suppose Vanguard is the only one left with web details?
<Xavier> you tell it what namespaces to use, it finds them in the assembly search path, etc
<Sirius> right...
<Xavier> I can always get into the database if I have to Taos
<Xavier> MS will always have dominance because (a) their development tools and dev support are second to none, 
  and (b) their level of documentation is in a class by itself
<Taos> I'll get DP to activate me as an admin on the forums when he appears
<Xavier> rgr
<Sirius> right
<Sirius> I do like the .NET SDK documentation actually.
<Sirius> It's a case of ... well ... you don't really need anything else so far
<Taos> actually, MS's tools may be second to none but quality wise they are matched in a few places
<Xavier> Windows doesn't dominate because it's the best OS...it dominates because it has always been the easiest 
  to develop apps for, and apps drive OS usage....witness the lack of penetration of MacOS in any form
<Darkhorse> Van has been half-dead for some time.
<Sirius> umm
<Sirius> Maybe I've been looking the wrong way
<Taos> I know, and haven't seen Lycan either
<Sirius> MFC is a lot easier than Win32 to use, I suppose?
<Taos> MFC suxxorz
<Xavier> eh, I am not too much on MFC, but it does make developing windows apps a breeze
<Sirius> ah
<Xavier> Win32 I can live with, it's like developing in COM ;)
<Sirius> Win32 gave me a headache the first time I looked at it
<Sirius> it still does, just not as much so
<Xavier> but WIndows.Forms makes it just too dakn easy
<Taos> yeah, with pre canned forms that are actually far more difficult to interact with at a code level than 
  they need be
<Sirius> that's the .NET approach?
<Xavier> for windows apps
<Xavier> web forms in ASP.NET is pretty simple too
<Xavier> program your web pages like they were windows apps
<Taos> mfc pre canned forms I mean
<Xavier> they really scored one big with .NET
<Xavier> taos: right
<Sirius> weird thing is ... well ... Java's Swing is actually quite simple to use in comparison
<Sirius> heck knows why
<Xavier> I just never have met the Java IDE that I liked
<Xavier> they all seem clumsy to me
<Taos> I hate trying to interface with MFC forms, that is where borland really 1 upped MS with VCL
<Xavier> and slow
<Sirius> Yeah... Eclipse isn't bad
<Sirius> but I haven't tried anything else
<Xavier> even Eclipse seems slow to me
<Sirius> and it's not terribly fast either, hah
<Xavier> I love it for C++ and PHP development, but it seesm to take forever for Java apps
<Sirius> Eclipse is better than Dev-C++ is though... I tried that and went back to Notepad
<Xavier> Dev-C++ is a POS
<Sirius> agreed. Totally agreed. :)
<Xavier> for a non-MS IDE Code::Blocks looks very promising
<Sirius> Indentation system is incredibly POOR.
* SG_01 has joined #cos-dev
<Xavier> Code::Blocks + VC2k3 Toolkit makes for a nice alternative...but you don't get the stuff you really need 
  to write windows apps that way
<Sirius> right
<Xavier> welcome SG!
<Taos> Can I interrupt momentarilly
<Xavier> sure
<Sirius> I imagine VS.NET 2k3 would be a good idea for me to get one day... it's just that it's expensive even 
  with an academic license
<Taos> I'd like everyone to meet a long time friend of mine, SG will be joining our programming team after he has 
  a chance to familliarise himself and settle
<Sirius> Ah, cool
<Xavier> @Sirius: when SlitScan (former CoS dev) worked at MS I got it for the MS employee price: US$125 ;)
<Sirius> Ah
<Sirius> That's not really that steep I guess
<Xavier> not for a $1200 IDE ;)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> heya SG <bows>
<SG_01> Lo there <bows>
* Thoth waves
<Sirius> Visual Studio .Net Pro 2003... NZ$250 from the university's IT outlet... that's quite reasonable
<Xavier> assuming 2:1 NZ:US that's about right
<Sirius> Um
* Taos slaps [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng around a bit with a large trout
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> X_x
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng eats the trout
<Sirius> NZ$1 ~= US$0.68-69 at the moment I think
<Taos> sorry, can't let you ausies get too big or anything
<Sirius> so it's a bit more
<Sirius> but
<Sirius> not that much
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ;)
<Sirius> if you're the only one here
<Sirius> yes, 2-to-1
<Elisor-sleeping> morning guys, does the meeting start in 15 mins?
<Taos> is the NZ dollar that much below the AU?
<Sirius> Um
* Elisor-sleeping is now known as Elisor
<Sirius> Not hugely.... $.90 AU = $1 NZ I think
<Sirius> maybe the AUD is a bit higher though
<Taos> yeah, that put you 70 some odd cents US then
<Sirius> I think we used to be, might have gone back up
<Sirius> whoa.
<Sirius> it looks more like 94 AU cents
<Taos> I think my dollar is worth 86 or 87 cents US right now
* SG_01 slaps the AU$ with the EUR
<Sirius> USD... about 70, yeah
<Thoth> brb
<Darkhorse> it's about 69.5 cents.
* Thoth is now known as thoth_smoke_and_a_drink_brb
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng throws some AU dollars to the NZ plebs
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng also runs
<Darkhorse> I don't need your Monopoly money.
<Darkhorse> :p
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> hehe
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> right .. when is this shindig suppose to start?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i got the booze and the hookers who brought the drugs?
* thoth_smoke_and_a_drink_brb is now known as thoth
<Darkhorse> In about nine minutes.
<thoth> damn, first flight out
* SG_01 throws some eurocents at Asmudius
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng pays the hookers with them .. gets slapped
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> X_o
<SG_01> haha
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> well there goes the entertainment
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng starts drinking
* thoth raises glass
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng wears one of those beer hats
<thoth> hehe
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> best invention evar
<Xavier> k we'll get moving in about 5-10 min
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> brb in 5 then :)
<thoth> well i prefer alchohol to IDE and compiler discussions, but theres little to say...
<thoth> and with that, the time has come
<thoth> ;)
<thoth> ... to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax
<thoth> next line anyone?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> umm ...
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> nope sry i dont know :P
<thoth> of ca...
<thoth> cabages and kings
<thoth> cabbages*
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> whats that from?
<thoth> Alice in Wonderland
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ahh ... the ultimate drug induced story
<thoth> well, you'll have to read eco's Island of the day before
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> nice n weird?
<thoth> yeah
<Darkhorse> 5-10 minutes yet?
<thoth> eco was just curious about writing in english for kicks
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> heh
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> no idea Dark i am talking shit to fill in time :)
<Xavier> lol
<Xavier> ok
<Xavier> I guess this is it
<Xavier> ========================================= CUT LINE ============================================
<Xavier> I just want to give a brief status update, where we are, what we need, where we are going
* SG_01 grabs a pair of scissors
<Xavier> here's the topics from the forums:
<Xavier> # With Cimex stepping down, we need a new Concept team lead
<Xavier> # Progress towards 0.2 (remaining issues) and looking forward to the 0.3 featureset (reference the 
  overview topic at http://www.clashofsteel.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=597 )
<Xavier> # State of completeness of the overall concept (background, history, traits, etc); this will have to be 
  summarized by someone else since Cimex is not available
<Xavier> # General Q&A 
<Xavier> and also
<Xavier> I also want to go over what needs to be done to create a GUI "skin" of our own, and have someone commit 
  to doing it
<Xavier> Item 1: Cimex has left the team, said he didn't ahve the time anymore, so the CDT is going to need to 
  figure out who they want to have the responsibility of interfacing with the other project teams (modellers, 
  programmers, etc)
<Taos> On your first note Xavier, can we touch on positions that need be filled in general, not just Cimex'
<Xavier> I think his is the only one
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> are all other team leads filled and active?>
<Xavier> I guess technically we need a graphics lead, but there's really not much that needs to be done in terms 
  of graphics, unless I misread the team function
<Xavier> Taos has the PR team, I have the devs,
<Xavier> I guess we need a modelling lead
<Xavier> since Flynn is AWOL
<Taos> we are going to need to touch base with Flynn at some point in reguards to artistic, and there are many 
  member positions that need be filled and I need to know what specifically so I can start recruiting
<Xavier> one thing that the team leads does...is documentation....Cimex did that wonderfully
<Xavier> for modellers, we just need to get ours back from HC
<Taos> flynn was supposed to cover artistic in the sense of 2d and 3d art
<Xavier> rgr
<Xavier> the main thing I need in terms of 2D art right now, is a GUI
<Xavier> that's item 5
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> for GUI stuff Lycan was doing some good stuff but i dont know how available he is
<Xavier> it was a start, but it was just a background
<Xavier> I guess we can do the GUI now
<Xavier> ah let's finish the positions first
<Xavier> sorry
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> :)
<Xavier> CDT lead
<Xavier> someone has to be the point person for questions regarding the concept
<Xavier> either to know where to find the answers in the docs, or to know the answers outright
<Xavier> the concept is mostly documented
<Xavier> also
<Xavier> the CDT lead will soon become the Test Team lead
<Xavier> ;)
<thoth> well, I would think Heng is the obvious choice
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> well the only ppl active in CDT are me, Thoth Gohan and AFO at this point
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i can take over if needed ... though i am not the most organised person
<Xavier> keep in mind that when you start firm testing, you'll swell in numbers
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> true
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i am keen on testing though
<Xavier> testing is an art of its own
<Taos> even technology demo's will draw attention to our project and releaseable tech demo's aren't too far off 
  by the looks of it
<Xavier> correct
<Taos> and in reguards to the testing Gohan is very good with organisation in that reguards and I will help as I 
  can as well
<Taos> speaking of Gohan
<Xavier> rgr
<Taos> where is he?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> speak of the devil?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> :P
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> not sure
<Xavier> I suggest you guys discuss it among the CDT and figure out who wants the job
<Taos> he's an odd one to be mia
<Xavier> testing is a thankless task but the most important one in terms of success
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i'll make a post about in the CDT forum
<Taos> anyhow, this is my recruitment draft at present for CDT, any alterations or objections note them now
<Xavier> rgr, hope for a resolution this week?
<Taos> CDT
<Taos>   -lead
<Taos>   -editors
<Taos>   -content developers
<Taos>   -creative writers
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> we should yes X
<Xavier> is that it, T?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> what is a content dev?
<Taos> I'd like to get 1 or 2 creative writers to turn some of our universe rules into a real story as it reads 
  more like a TRO than a novel
<Darkhorse> Was going to ask the same.
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i am writing some stories but i have been lazy of late :(
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> gime a deadline and i will prob work better hehe
<Taos> you are content devs, the ones drafting the rules and requirements, essentially everyone onthe team is a 
  content dev
<Sirius> For universe rules, a TRO isn't exactly a bad format... well, okay
<Sirius> at least a sourcebook
<Sirius> for the storyline, it's pretty ... yeah
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> TROs are good for techy stuff
<Taos> oops, it's supposed to say concept devs
<Sirius> right
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> for our factions, and how they work it can be used
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> for characters and more in depth universe stuff a good story can spell things out
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> along with some good piccies and a good soundtrack :)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> the whole multimedia glut ;)
<SG_01> Haha, yep, that always works :P
<Taos> what you have written our there is very good for faction, planet and tech outlines, but we want to 
  introduce first with more freeform story and then give them the hard info
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> thoguh for the "look" of the universe we are still kinda fiddling with motifs for each 
  faction
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> sure Mr T, as i said i'll see if i can get more stories done
* Gohan has joined #cos-dev
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> was gonna have a short story for each faction
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i just gotta get my arse outta gaming for a while
<Taos> ah, speaking of mexican slave labor
<Darkhorse> Evening G-sus.
<Gohan> cheap labor
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> G-Maaaaan
<SG_01> Lo there
<Xavier> 'lo Gohan
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng gives Gohan a magic bean to clean his shoes
<Xavier> hide the sheep
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> yea those new zealanders ...
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng runs again
<Gohan> ugh, my hands are sore
<Gohan> stupid GC controller
<Darkhorse> We have stashes here Asmu, there's no point hiding the excess.
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> anyway ... is there anything in particular that needs to be written in story form you could 
  use T?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> true Dark :P
<Taos> not really, for starters something short and attention grabbing
<Taos> maybe an introduction of a key character or something  but try to keep under 5 mins read
<Taos> that is bout the most specific I'd like to see and I have 1 particular goal for a short piece and that's 
  bout it
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> so an intro to our universe for release to the public
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> harder than it sounds :P
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ok i'll have a think onit
<Xavier> you da man ;)
<Taos> anything beyond that will help build the audience into the universe but format is not essential
<Sirius> Probably more of an example than an introduction? If you know what I mean
<Sirius> an introduction as a whole would be very broad
<Darkhorse> Seen the Guild Wars handbook?
<Darkhorse> That has an interesting "intro" in it.
<SG_01> Which one of the two, Dark? :P
<Darkhorse> First I think.
<Gohan> No one read that handbook.
<SG_01> That's the story book
<Darkhorse> Yeah, that one.
<Taos> pick something like a solari liason meeting  with the Kepi to notify them of Solari's friendship with Kepi 
  ceasing to be or some such
<Sirius> I did Gohan :/
<SG_01> The story book was pretty good
<Darkhorse> Sirius' slow ass machine took so long he had to do something.
<SG_01> It was the control manual I didn't read :P
<Sirius> that's the way
<Xavier> l, that all T?
<Sirius> working out the controls as you go
<Xavier> *k
<Taos> yes, sorry for slipping off topic
<Xavier> np, it's part of the "things we need done" general topic ;)
<SG_01> Which is very broad indeed ^^
<Taos> back to topic I believe you still need more for your team Xavier but I think we'll have to work on that 
  case by case
<Xavier> well we got two new programmers, Sirius and SG, both of who are here tonight :)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> what do we want to concentrate on in the sotry thoguh T ... the factions and thier wars? the 
  history? the catylist for war?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> w00t programmers!
<Xavier> Sirius is going to start working with the toolset, and SG is going to start with the C++ side of things 
<Darkhorse> The toolset?
<Sirius> Um
<Sirius> You know MW4's mission editor? Stuff like that
<Darkhorse> Ah.
<thoth> hehe
<Xavier> toolset = content development SDK
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> for modders? or is this the tools we use to make the game too?
<Xavier> the first thing he'll be working on is a GUI editor 
<Taos> Asmu, pick a histroical event and then play out 1 part of it, if you can't choose 1 then do 3 or 4 and 
  I'll slip one between each faction outline
<Xavier> we eat our own dog food here ;)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> a historical event recent to the current situation you mean? we got lots of history :)
<Taos> in english we build with our own tools so that we know they are complete and not comproised
<Taos> Asmu, PM ->
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> rgr
* Xavier takes cue ;)
<Xavier> ok moving one
<Xavier> *on
<Xavier> progress towards 0.2
<Xavier> those who have downloaded and ran the little demo know where that's at
<Xavier> load a heightmap terrain (MW4's Canyon in this case), put a model on it
<Xavier> the main part of the current 0.1.3 release is that it implements the basic main loop processing that the 
  rest of the code will build on
<Xavier> the thing we are waiting on before caling it a 0.2 is the rigged and animated model from Elisor
<Xavier> which is almost done
<Elisor> if we could figure out the technical issues :S
<Xavier> when we can move it around the terrain and control it with the key/mouse we can call that 0.2
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> whats the issues?
<Xavier> lol hiya Eli :)
<Xavier> mainly how to get the thing so that Ogre (the 3D library) can understand it
<Elisor> in short it's exporting rigid-body animations from Blender or MAX.  I've moved to MAX now, but am 
  hitting many of the same problems
<Xavier> we didn't have a lot of success in Blender so Eli went back to Max
<Xavier> hmm
<Elisor> the systems seem to be setup for characters, which have soft, deformable bodies.  we're trying to do 
  this with mechs
<Xavier> it may be an Ogre thing that we dont understand so I'll have to hit the Ogre forums
<Elisor> I can export a full, static mesh from MAX now, what I'm working on is getting it animated, then try to 
  fix the softbody issue
<Xavier> there have been robotic style models run in this engine
<Xavier> it's completely general
<Elisor> the actual animation is a breeze
<thoth> is this a function of the rigging or the exported rig in Ogre
<Xavier> if I could figure out how to get Ogre to work with multiple meshes parented to multiple armatures 
  (bones) we'd be fine
<Sidelink> use bones and umm whats it called...  one sec
<Xavier> exprted rig in Ogre
<Elisor> it must be possible, but at the mo I can't see how they've done it.  been through the forums but they 
  just seem to concentrate on softbody
<Xavier> the Blender Ogre exporter considers everything to be a separate object
<Xavier> and the Max exporter has its own issues (no maintainer for one)
<Xavier> so exporting from Blender, for exmple, only one armature seems to move
<Taos> Eli, once we figgure out exactly how we need the modellers to turn in thier meshes what would be a 
  conservative estimate as to animating time?
<Xavier> even tho it works great in Blender
<Elisor> the MAX one requires all parts to be attached as a single mesh, which means the bones act on all parts 
  of the mesh (depending on the envelope)
<Xavier> Eli: is that the same vertex group issue as in Blender>?
<Elisor> or a start/walk/stop anim including the rigging?  say it was a custom rig then 1-2 weeks.  it's not that 
  tough
<Elisor> or = for
<Sidelink> bones and linked xform modifier in max
<Elisor> it's similar, yes Xav
<Xavier> the way we did it in Blender, FYI all, is to model as component meshes (like MW models), assign the 
  vertex groups from those submeshes then join the whole thing as a single mesh
<Xavier> then you rig using a single armature made up of a ton of bones
<Xavier> bones which are named the same as the vertex groups they control
<thoth> but you can just turn off the deform in the blender bones
<Xavier> problem Eli ran into was a FK problem, the IK worked fine
<Taos> Ogre doesn't allow us IK animation?
<Xavier> thoth: I just assigned each submesh 1.0 weighting to a single group, and no affinity to any other group
<Xavier> 1 vertex, 1 group
<Xavier> and therefore one bone
<Xavier> taos: they don't have a solver, no
<Xavier> you can model with IK, but you have to do it as keyframes
<thoth> k, well without looking at Ogre and whats involved in the export, i am just asking
<Xavier> they just do interpolations in Ogre
<Xavier> I wasnt aware there was another way to do it in Blender, thoth: anything easier is better ;)
<thoth> only used bones once, a while back with earlier Marshal model, will take a look at it
<Elisor> this must have been cracked before, and if you have really tight envelopes and lots of bones it might be 
  possible with the current system, but there has to be a more elegant solution
<Xavier> I agree
<Xavier> once we crack this, however, the next major version, 0.3, will be worked on
<Xavier> in the meantime, we have got to get someone to design a GUI
<Xavier> and that means not just the background, but the actual controls
<Xavier> the look and feel
<Sirius> How difficult are GUIs to implement with the tools we have?
<Xavier> simple
<Sirius> ah, nice.
<Xavier> they are XML text-file based
<Xavier> the XML defines everything about it
<Xavier> but the actual graphics are very much like UV mapping
<Xavier> those with SVN access should go to the katana/bin/resources directory and look at gui.zip
<Xavier> in there you see a Taharezlook.tga file
<Xavier> that's a lot like a UV texture
<Sirius> right
<Xavier> and the GUI system references that graphic to display the actual "things" in the GUI
<Xavier> three states of buttons, spinner controls, dropdowns, etc
<Xavier> everythingf
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> so this goes from the menus to the RnD LAB to actual in game stuff?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> or is in game stuff like HUD etc a different beast
<Xavier> anything that is a GUI control that will be used
<Xavier> HUDs are different
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> so pre-in game stuff really
<SG_01> HUDs arn't part of the GUI? :P
<Xavier> those are simple overlays and will also require alpha-channel techniques
<Xavier> no
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> rgr
<Xavier> the game has two major states: GUI and SIMULATION
<SG_01> Ah
<Xavier> the difference is in how input is handled
<Sirius> GUI is like Windows :)
<Xavier> the GUI state requires that input events be injected into it
<Xavier> the SIMULATION state, the game logic consumes the input events
<SG_01> I see
<Xavier> the GUI then does callbacks for functionality...in that way it;s like every other window system 
  including Windows
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> so what do we need
<Xavier> anyone done website mockups in Photoshop?
<Taos> I know just the person
<Xavier> when the client accepts a "comp" the graphic gets cut up into its component parts
<Xavier> and those parts are used in the website 
<Xavier> this is no different
<Sirius> Hm
<Taos> I normally do his cutting but he does some awesome UI work, but that's something we can discuss later
<Sirius> So, in a twisted way
<Xavier> I need someone to create graphic mockups of screens which will contain all of the interactive controls 
  we'll use in the GUI
<Sirius> vaguely like how they used to do bitmap fonts?
<Xavier> kinda
<Sirius> Except of course the scale varies
<Xavier> right, in this case, CEGUI uses TTF fonts ;)
<Xavier> wel
<Sirius> yeah
<Xavier> it uses anything that FreeType will deal with :)
<SG_01> Just like how Winamp skinning works basicaly :P
<Xavier> probably 
<Xavier> it's a common technique
<Taos> Xavier, we going to have to add resizes for each rez setting or can the GUI system handle dynamic resizing?
<Xavier> the TaharezLook TGA is 512x512
<Sirius> Is the TGA of fixed size?
<Xavier> I am trying to think of what 2D library it uses to do resizes
<Taos> it will scale then?
<Xavier> that demo comes from a 512x512 TGA so if the scaling lkooks ok then we should be good
<Xavier> we can always do multiple graphics
<Taos> kk, that saves a bit of zone
<Taos> bit of size
<Sirius> going to be one heck of a graphical design job, anyway, heh
<Xavier> yup
<Xavier> it will involve the CDT a lot
<Xavier> lots of back and forth
<Xavier> once it's OKed it can be cut up and formed into a single TGA and then we can use it in the GUI
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> what do you need from CDT at this time for the GUI?
<Xavier> think of how you want our widgets to look
<Xavier> sliders, buttons, dropdowns, list boxes, etc
<Xavier> whatever it is
<Taos> layout sketches for ideas would be helpfull, rules for what the GUI must accomplish is kinda a must
<Xavier> once we have an artist that can start doing renderings the work can start on that
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> did we do a flow chart for the GUI?
<Xavier> yup
<thoth> im interested in getting that rolling
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> the actual look and feel i think the artists should give us some examples
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i dont think the CDT needs to control that part too much
<Xavier> https://svn.clashofsteel.net:8445/cos/trunk/doc/Katana-Processing-Flow.gif
<Xavier> right
<Xavier> the artist will want some concept to start with tho
<Taos> at very least try to develop guidelines for theme
<Xavier> maybe a basic overview of the "feel" of the universe
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> rgr, who is the artist(s) that will be doing this
<Xavier> in the meantime we can use the base Taharezlook theme for development...since all widgets have the same 
  behavior in CEGUI it will be no problem to swap in the new imageset
<Taos> if we don't have any volunteers internally I'll bring in someone
<thoth> id like to have a go
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> Lycan was the only one i was aware that was doing stuff like that ... in any event please 
  get them to contact the CDT team
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> and thoth can also have a go :)
<Xavier> :-D
<Taos> take a go at it Thoth
<thoth> rgr
<Darkhorse> for user interfaces, don't forget that a 3D element can work as well
<Xavier> not as easily
<Darkhorse> I think there were many space sims that had examples of that
<thoth> understood, dark
<Xavier> 3D picking is tricky at best
<Xavier> but
<Xavier> nm
<Darkhorse> Wing Commander, Freespace come to mind
<Xavier> I se what you mean
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> if anyone needs info from the CDT team please contact us though .. we have so much stuff 
  going that it is hard to put out all the info you need
<Xavier> 2D rendering of 3D object? 
<Darkhorse> yeah
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> better you ask us and we respond
<Xavier> ohh good idea :)
<Sirius> hmm
<Sirius> Just checked out the flowchart - I take it no single player is planned? :)
<Xavier> ok so that takes care of item 5 I guess...we'll take that up further in the forums
<Xavier> aye, no SP at this time
<Sirius> Right
<Taos> yes, designing interfaces in a #D interface, skinning them, and then rendering out to @d and cutting could 
  work quite well
<Xavier> which also reduces the development load, since no AI is needed
<Sirius> (I know about jack about the game proper at the moment)
<Sirius> True
<Sirius> Well, there is the training bit
<Sirius> however that works
<Gohan> press X to shoot
<SG_01> X? :P
<Xavier> right, but the only scripting support we need is for MP game rulesets
<Gohan> I am still stuck in SSBM mode.
<Xavier> hee
<Sirius> sounds respectable
<Taos> AI will pretty much be it's own endeavor if at all
<Xavier> definintely a post-1.0 if we even do it
<Sirius> are there plans to have AI being addable if you know what I mean - through scripting etc?
<Xavier> not at present
<Sirius> right
<Darkhorse> No automated turrets?
<Xavier> the concept is pretty much for an MP-only experience
<Sirius> lol
<Sirius> that's really quite easy if you want that
<Xavier> not decided yet DH
<Xavier> that is minor AI at best, however
<Taos> there are libraries that could be bound into it by a team that wished to do so through the logic code so 
  it will never be impossible, probably difficult at best though
<Xavier> doesn't require paths or any real decision making ability
<Sirius> it'd probably be 'closest enemy I can see' material... even I can tell you how to figure that out
<SG_01> Xavier: If you're going to have a Training mission, simple paths might be an option though :P
<Sirius> Oh, and one last n00b question... macro/micro ... what's that? :)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> lol
<Gohan> Macro is akin to a 'Mech.
<Darkhorse> Macros are like Battlemechs
<Darkhorse> Micros, battle armour.
<Sirius> Right
<Darkhorse> Well, powered BA.
<Xavier> SG: but not something we need to support in terms of mission editing (like in the MW editor where you 
  can define paths, etc)
<SG_01> Right
<SG_01> Not too familiar with the MW editor, but the Freespace editor also had paths in it ;)
<Darkhorse> Or you could hard-code the training mission. Teehee.
<Xavier> right
<SG_01> Haha
<Xavier> probably will do it that way
<SG_01> Hardcode in the logic I take it then
<Xavier> I don't expect the training to be much more than the first levels in AA
<Sirius> Parallax did that for the Descent 2 single-player campaign and I hated them for it. *cough* but anyway.
<thoth> so any environmental type effects  ie similar to birds flying etc
<thoth> ...
<Gohan> An explanation of the controls and key commands, hoo rah.
<Xavier> for the most part it's tehre to help test "lab" (R&D) designs
<Xavier> thoth: for "naturals", we really hadn't considered them yet
<thoth> i c
<Xavier> haven't really figured out the CPU budget because tech is changing too much right now
<Xavier> between parallel physics accelerators and dual-core machines and SLI making a comebck...
<Sirius> physics accelerators now?
<Xavier> there will be a HUGE gap between the low end and flamethrower soon
<Xavier> www.aegia.com
<Xavier> bash
<Xavier> bah
<Xavier> ageia
<Xavier> www.ageia.com
<Sirius> there's already a huge gap between the low end and my computer... except it's in the wrong direction
<Taos> tech prices will likely drop fast though with the constant stream of major makeovers so the gap may not be 
  so bad as we think
<Xavier> Novodex was either bought by or became, Ageia
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> btw
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> Modular Armor Combat Robotics (MACRo)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> Modular Infantry Combat Robotics (MICRo) 
<Sirius> ah
<Xavier> ok moving on....
<Sirius> I swear, some people are far too good at acronyms
<Gohan> imho that is true
<Xavier> the next rfelease, 0.3, will see netowrked MP and scriting support (mainly for MP gametype rulesets, but 
  also possibly for test automation as well), and "eye candy" and positional audio
<Xavier> by "eye candy" I mean what are now becoming common modelling and rendering techniques
<Gohan> positional audio?
<Xavier> 3D audio
<Xavier> EAX for example
<Gohan> oh
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> when will we get more modellers from HC btw?
<Taos> EAX, dolby, all through OpenAL
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> and how much do they know of the CoS universe
<Xavier> apparently when they learn to model, asmu ;)
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng looks at the models
<Xavier> hehe
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i think they can O_O
<Sirius> that would be a nice start, yeah...
<Sirius> asmu
<Sirius> which ones? ;)
<Xavier> they still make lots of mistakes asmu
<Gohan> the bottleneck right now is that the teachers HC has are few in number
<thoth> well i dont know where all these mythical modelers in HC are?
<thoth> what 5 ppl maybe
<Darkhorse> ...hmm
<Xavier> had more than that not too long ago I thought
<Darkhorse> Natas shows promise, the rest I wouldn't say can hack it yet.
<Taos> Asmu, most of them can make pretty models that will work with Scanners touch ups and MW4's simplified 
  engine, but they would be in real trouble with the advanced techniques we are using here due to some bad 
  habbits in the basics
<Xavier> this project will live and die on the modelling, btw
<Xavier> it's really more important than the programming
<Gohan> None of them are really HC modelers until a completed model is presented.
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ok
<Gohan> and by completed I mean the entire package
<thoth> my point exactly gohan
<Xavier> we ahve some really mature and fantastic libraries we can use for just about everything on the 
  programming end, so we are basically gluing it all together...but for the gamer, the models ARE the game
<Gohan> 12 low poly models are useless without the rest.
<thoth> so there is scanner, thrashdog, fireslave, XXX
<thoth> Darkhorse ;)
<Taos> Lupus will be about before too long once he has something for his creations to come alive in
<Gohan> 3 out of 4 which are afk.
<thoth> Redspace
<thoth> that covers it, right?
<Darkhorse> hmm... maybe, I thought there was someone else too
<Xavier> thing is, success breeds success, and product attracts talent
<Darkhorse> who did the Crusader?
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ok, i do hope they get into the CoS universe though so they do not have too many BT 
  misconceptions
<Sirius> yeah
<Xavier> once we have something to show, we can actually start recruiting from the rest of the game community
<Sirius> We very well may find interested parties outside of NBT
<thoth> true, im just thinking this "getting our modelers back from HC" thing is getting old and not really a 
  valid problem
<Taos> exactly, flashy tech demo's will draw modellers and programmers to the extent that we have to be really 
  picky as to who we accept
<Xavier> if we can get 12 dedicated modellers/animators (at least one more of which is a talented animator) we 
  should be at a good level
<Darkhorse> hehe, I've only done marginal animation so far
<Xavier> that means 12 productive talented persons who can get it done
<Taos> thoth, 1 or 2 of the modellers that went to work on HC focusing on CoS would suffice for now
<Xavier> Eli just about is the default animation lead
<Xavier> well he's the only animator right now ;)
<Elisor> *ducks back in hole
<Xavier> btw I am damn glad to have you all...the CDT has been simply amazing in its dedication and progress
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> if i could do this full time i would ;)
<Xavier> but once we have something respectable to show, I expect the team to swell to about 40, to be honest
<Taos> so far AFO is the only one who's focused on CoS models and they aren't exactly up to production grade as 
  they are more concept than game models
<Xavier> right T
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> we do need some concept stuff to find the "feel" of our factions 
<Darkhorse> Some art direction in other words.
<Darkhorse> ;)
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> yes ... i suck at art
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i am a hack writer thats all ;)
<Sirius> hack writers of the world unite
<Taos> we need 2d artists but they are a quirky breed and hard to come by if you find a good one
<Sirius> I mean, dude
<Sirius> you can look fairly decent by just having an imagination, a good grasp of the English language and 
  knowing how to spell sometimes
<Darkhorse> What kind of 2D art?
<Taos> and I'm sure nobody wants me doing any drawing, I'm an out of practice toonist with a broken tablet
<Darkhorse> yeah, I'm not necessarily the greatest drawer around but that won't stop me having a good go at it
<Xavier> for one, DH, the GUI
<Sirius> it's fine for concept type stuff, obviously
<Taos> what we were after in the beginning was some sketch artists to visualise some of the concept discussion 
  but we've not really had any luck
<Xavier> keep in the back of your mind the need for a set of HUD graphics
<Darkhorse> but I should stop volunteering myself for things anyway
<Xavier> hehe
<SG_01> I might see what I can do with Photoshop, though I can't promise it'll be any good ^^
<Xavier> hehe
<Taos> don't suppose anyones got an old graphire that they've upgraded and no longer need the stylus?
<Sirius> heheh
<thoth> im not very good either but i can draw some basic shapes, ill get back to it
<Darkhorse> graphire?
<Taos> yes, graphire tablet
<Darkhorse> is that anything like Letraset?
<Xavier> ok I guess that about wraps up everything I wanted to discuss...does anyone have any questions (besides 
  Dogstar and SG, who probably have tons)?
<Darkhorse> oh, guess not :p
<thoth> i work better with a team, so perhaps Dark and I can try to work off each other or some such idea
<SG_01> Haha ^_^
<thoth> when do paychecks go out, again?
<thoth> ;P
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> lol
<Taos> 2010
<Xavier> lol
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i am holding you to that Mr T!
<SG_01> Taos: I was thinking about when Christmis and Easter fall on the same day :P
<Taos> and you'll be well worth the 10 cents Asmu
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> :D
<SG_01> hehe
<Darkhorse> well, it would be nice if I could figure out exactly how models are translated into the 3D engine :)
<Darkhorse> but that's not so much a question as a MORE MORE
<Taos> the exporter is in the forums there
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> well all i want to say is if anyone wants info about the universe do not hesistate to send a 
  PM or email to me or the CDT ppl
<Darkhorse> yeah, I should have a look at it Taos
<Sirius> translating models into the 3D engine could well become my job later on ... but we'll see how it goes
<Darkhorse> oh, one other thing
<Xavier> DH: Ogre has exporters for just about every modelling package; it exports to a .xml intermediate format, 
  which is then converted to a binary format with a command-line tool; the .mesh files are loadable by the engine
<Sirius> ahhh
<Sirius> that's better :)
<Darkhorse> it may be a good idea to sticky something about the cultural artistic definition for each of the four 
  factions (hope that makes sense)
<Gohan> or, the style of each faction so modelers know what is up
<Sirius> DH - for um
<Darkhorse> just to say what the feel of the factions is/are.
<Gohan> in other words
<Sirius> a kind of coherent style? Right
<Xavier> DH: some of them can export directly to .mesh; Ogre is an XSI partner so XSI has the best export 
  support, since the project owner can write exporters for the format he wrote ;)
<Darkhorse> yeah, that Gohan
<Taos> DH, hit the Wiki for faction info
<Taos> if you need an account contact myself or Xavier
<Xavier> if you need access let me know
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> this is why we need some artistic direction .. we have vague motifs for each faction but 
  nothing locked in
<Xavier> ot Taos
<Darkhorse> I don't remember being able to get so far into the Wiki
<Xavier> btw, for a tentative timeline (ignote the dates for now) look at http://www.clashofsteel.net/forums/viewt
  opic.php?t=597
<Darkhorse> yeah, looks like you have still to hook my ass up :b
<Xavier> I'll get it Taos; I have to hook up SG and Sirius when we're done here
<SG_01> I still need some account(s) activated/created, but I guess you're alright on that then ;)
<Xavier> yup
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i havent used the wiki much myself as i wrote most of it i dont look again
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> is it too hard to find faction info?
<Darkhorse> only when it's verboten
<Taos> you had best get SG on the forums also, don't look like you managed to get my access upgrade to work
<Xavier> I'll work on that too Taos
<Taos> even did a cookie dump to be sure
<Xavier> just have to find the right table
<Taos> it looks like your access is set proper
<Taos> see if you can find the admin interface and do it through the boards themselves
<SG_01> Somewhere http://www.clashofsteel.net/forums/admin/ I guess :P
<thoth> Asmu: the concept roundtable link on wiki is best bet
<SG_01> It should be possible to activate my account from there :P
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> just wanna make sure the wiki is easy for all members to use if it is not it might need to 
  be adjusted
<thoth> i think it needs adjusting, to be sure
<thoth> but usage would be a good start
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng looks at Gohan
<Gohan> whoa what I do
<Gohan> I did not steal that car
<Gohan> but I did kill the channel
<SG_01> hehe\
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng shoots Gohan
<Taos> concept and programming stuff is in a block at the top of the page when you are logged in, don't think it 
  could be easier to find in the wiki than that, and pretty well anything regular users should need to do with it 
  will be done from the pages themselves
<Sirius> yes.
<Xavier> I need to move all Wiki content over to the site
<Xavier> how much CDT content is on the Wiki>?
<Xavier> I should just have used the site to begin with
<Xavier> my fault :(
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> http://www.clashofsteel.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Concept+Development+Roundtable
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ah ok
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> there is a heap of stuff there i had forgotton about
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> including art directions
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> http://www.clashofsteel.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Kepi+Unit+Design+Rules
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> for instance
<Xavier> ok, at this point if there are no other questions, I'd like to adjourn  for the night/day (you don't 
  have to leave but you don't have to stick around if you don't want)
<Xavier> we'll do this every month
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> awesome :)
<Xavier> probably first Sat each month
* thoth waves
<Elisor> agreed Xav.  got a lot of work done while here ;)
<Xavier> I want to start having a set amount of work that will be done each month, for all teams
<thoth> was good to be here
<Xavier> :)
<Xavier> nite thoth!
<Xavier> glad to have you here :)
* thoth has left #cos-dev
<Darkhorse> see you around then.
<Xavier> nite DH!
<Darkhorse> I ain't going yet. :)
<Darkhorse> someone else was, I think.
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> ok, byt the end of this month i am gonna have as much story written as i can for my personal 
  goal anyway
<SG_01> he was already gone :P
<Darkhorse> oh... dumb.
<Xavier> I think the only way to move the project along on a regular basis is to identify small tasks for each 
  group and dev to get done bt the next meeting
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> yes good idea
<Darkhorse> serves me right for trying to figure out footnotes.
<Sirius> Do we need more programmers still Xavier? Can't say I know any personally though, at least not that I 
  would expect to be interested
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i got a few jobs i'll delegate to others in the CDT team
<Xavier> yep
<Xavier> Sirius: yep
<Xavier> I 6-7 total is a nice number
<Xavier> hmm
<Xavier> 6-7 total is a good number
<Sirius> apart from perhaps that guy who sits on a chat channel with an away message "please talk to me if you 
  know anything about Delphi" for 1-2 weeks straight
<Sidelink> I didn't answer your question on the forum Xavier.  I don't know what faction it was for or role, it 
  was just an image in my head bugging me
<Xavier> hehe
<Sirius> obviously no-one there does, but he still leaves it up...
<Xavier> lol
<Sirius> personally, if I want to know anything about a programming language I hit Google or something ... but he 
  is 14 or 15 I guess
<SG_01> Google, MSDN, whatever, should be easy enough to find >.>
<Darkhorse> in other words, even if he was interested, the answer is no
<Xavier> I know a lot of people like just to ask the question without looking first...it drives forum regulars in 
  Ogre nutz
<Sirius> yep DH :)
<Sirius> lol, right
<Sirius> I see a lot of that sort of people, unfortunately, and not just programming types either
<Xavier> yup
<SG_01> Hehe, too true
<SG_01> Lazy bums
<Sirius> was a classic a couple of days ago
<Xavier> it's a normal human trait, just to ask the person you know must know....however, that's why there are 
  IRC channels for most projects ;)
<Taos> and the reason I hide from Tox
<Darkhorse> haha
<Taos> oops, did I say that out loud?
<Xavier> rofl
<Darkhorse> I get that regarding texture mapping for some reason.
<Xavier> hehe UV mapping is not hard, it's just friggin tedious
<Sirius> someone was asking on an internet forum what Kali and UDP were... and was told fairly impolitely to go 
  to Google and look it up... his response was something along the lines of "well I get sick of searching through 
  10 pages and finding nothing relevant when people right here know the answer"
<Darkhorse> yeah, exactly
<Xavier> roflmao sirius
<Darkhorse> does Ogre have any issues with Blender's texture mapping?
<Sirius> I keyed "Kali" and "UDP" into Google, hit "I'm Feeling Lucky" and got exactly the information he wanted
<Xavier> nothing relevant on UDP, LOL
<Sirius> yeah, exactly
<Xavier> none that I know of DH
<Darkhorse> yeah, UDP gets you the Wikipedia article first result
<Darkhorse> Kali gets you the company's website.
<Sirius> Wasn't Wikipedia, I think it was Webopedia, but still
<Taos> ugh, UDP, I'm gonna go hide now
<Xavier> lol
<Xavier> Raknet uses "reliable" UDP for its connections :p
<Taos> that just means that they have already done the part I am afraid of
<Xavier> you simply cannot use TCP for gaming, it's too heavy
<Xavier> yup
<Xavier> Raknet will make MP networking a snap with this
<SG_01> There is no such thing as Reliable UPD, just a programmed layer that simulates it :P
<Taos> implimentation of the custom packet delivery guarantee system
<Xavier> especially if we use the DNO support (Distributed Network Object)
<Sirius> The only thing I like about TCP over UDP
<Sirius> is that the cavemen who designed my router didn't get it wrong
<SG_01> hah
<Taos> the only problem with TCP is that it's blocking
<Xavier> yup
<Xavier> and it's 1:1 and no other way around it
<Xavier> non-scalable in MMO scenarios
<Sirius> I know almost nothing concrete about networks, but if memory serves TCP is a layer over UDP, which is a 
  layer over IP?
<Xavier> and way too heavy to set up and tear down
<Xavier> more or less Sirius
<Xavier> TCP and UDP are separate tho
<Sirius> ah, ok
<Sirius> I was just told you can emulate TCP more or less exactly with UDP
<SG_01> You can have a TCP and a UDP listener on the same port if you want :P
<Xavier> true
<Xavier> which is what DirectPlay does
<Xavier> 2300-2400 for both
<Darkhorse> okay, so what relevant model translators should I be looking for?
<Xavier> for Blender?
<Taos> yes, you pretty much have TCP when you get your guaranteed delivery routines into your UDP code
<Darkhorse> yeah, that's probably the best option
<Taos> but then it's still more efficient
<Xavier> http://www.ogre3d.org/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=74&func=selectcat&cat=5
<SG_01> And you don't have to worry about the Stream that's in TFCP
<SG_01> Though you can write your own stream into the mix if you really feel like recreating TCP in UDP :P
<Darkhorse> haha you didn't even need to ask which one :p
<Xavier> ;)
<Xavier> keep in mind that the Maya one has just been picked up again, the max one has no maintainer and has some 
  issues, but the Blender and XSI ones are actively supported and developed
<Xavier> if you grab the meshviewer you can load up the exports in the same engine that the game uses
<Sirius> is the engine planned to work more like MW4 or UT in terms of structure? Sounded like MW4
<Xavier> don't know yet
<Sirius> ok
<SG_01> Ooh, a Meshviewer, that brings me back...
<Xavier> I really don't want to have to use multiple body parts
<Xavier> it's horrible for performance (kills batching in the GPU)
<SG_01> Freespace (2) used to have a meshviewer ^_^
<Xavier> hehe
<Sirius> meshviewer?
<Elisor> Isn't the bargan basement version of XSI free?
<Xavier> I want to figure out a way to peform collision detection using intersecting vertices and map them to 
  bones, and using the bone names figure out which body part was affected
<Xavier> no more hitbox generation
<SG_01> Shows a how a Mesh looks ^^
<Sirius> as in something that displays the in-game 3D models?
<Xavier> at the least, I want to generate bounding volumes during the load and not rely on humans to make them ;)
<Darkhorse> ah, this should be helpful
<SG_01> Yea
<Sirius> which uhm, are probably meshes... hehe
<Sirius> funny thing is, I probably know who the guy that did it was
<Xavier> Eli: it's great for learning XSI but unless you are making HL2 mods or paying the license, it's no good
<Xavier> can't export shit
<Darkhorse> Heiko Herrmann
<Sirius> hmmm
<Darkhorse> I think.
<Sirius> not so sure about HH, might have been Garry
<Sirius> but ...
<Darkhorse> It was related to the Descent 2 PMView.
<Darkhorse> Yeah, probably was actually.
<Sirius> Garry wrote PMView
<Darkhorse> Ah, would have been then.
* Gohan has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
<Sirius> he came, he saw, he lagged out :(
<Taos> lol
<SG_01> hehe
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> doeth
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> bastard
<Darkhorse> ./mourn Gohan
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> was just PMing him
<Sirius> fs2view. Yep, probably.
<Sirius> cob2fs2 as well, heh
<SG_01> hehe
<Sirius> if memory serves that was for people that wanted to make custom ships for Freespace
<SG_01> Yep, cause fs2 used it's own model type I believe
<Darkhorse> I still wanted to pilot a Hatshepsut.
<Sirius> Yeah, it was its own data format
<SG_01> I only changed the textures on some ships once ^_^
<Sirius> I don't know how much code Freespace had that originated in Descent/Descent 2, but I heard there was some
<SG_01> Heh, prolly
<Darkhorse> The basic display engine I think.
<Sirius> always seems to have been their style to use their own model formats though
<Sirius> ah
<Sirius> er
<Darkhorse> Though I hope they fixed the BSP problems.
<Sirius> I would suspect so, it was 3D accelerated
<Sirius> and ... well, Descent's 3D engine sucked
<Sirius> IMHO :)
<SG_01> The Freespace series was near flawless
<Sirius> It probably used depth buffering
<Darkhorse> That was because they were too lazy for software anti-aliasing Sir.
<Sirius> Descent took shortcuts to avoid that
<Sirius> because it was written for 486s
<Sirius> um
<Sirius> DH, I have my doubts anti-aliasing ever happened in 1995
<Darkhorse> No, in FS.
<Sirius> Oh
<Sirius> Right
<Darkhorse> Probably D3 too actually. Hehe
<Sirius> who the hell wants to do that kind of stuff manually anyway? ;)
<Sirius> help, I'm getting IM spammed :(
<Darkhorse> Well, there are 32-bit textures I suppose.
<Darkhorse> Though... if I remember correctly they were running on 24-bit at the time.
<SG_01> Did the Freespace 3 project ever get anywhere?
<Darkhorse> Nah, it was cancelled.
<Sirius> there was one?
<SG_01> There was a community project for it
<Sirius> Ah
<Darkhorse> That would have failed in that case.
<Sirius> I wonder if THQ has enough clue to figure out that a Freespace 3 would probably sell
<Darkhorse> Even BWO never seemed to get finally completed.
<Darkhorse> It would sell on console.
<Sirius> anything sells on console :/
<Darkhorse> FS2 is just one of those legendary games that never really sold.
<SG_01> Volition wanted to do it, but Interplay didn't let them
<Sirius> figures
<Darkhorse> oh yeah... because Interplay own the rights
<SG_01> Exactly
<Darkhorse> same as that "Descent 4" thing
<Sirius> difference is
<Darkhorse> of course you can always just rename it
<Sirius> FS3 would almost certainly work now
<Sirius> D4 is anyone's guess
<SG_01> There havn't been too many "good" games story-wise lately
<SG_01> Especially no games like FS
<Darkhorse> Games don't really sell for the story.
<Sirius> Anyone that remembers Descent now would probably think "haha, that weird-ass game"
<Darkhorse> RPGs might, but sadly, anything else...
<Xavier> I long for Duke Nukem 3D
<Xavier> hehe
<Xavier> very playable game
<Sirius> heheh
<Sirius> It wasn't too bad, I recall
<Xavier> good exdample of waht you can do with a sprite-based engine
<SG_01> Hehe, not at all
<Sirius> I never figured out the 5th level of the demo though
<Sirius> or whichever one it was
<Sirius> but I was 10 or something at the time I guess
<SG_01> hehe, me too, somewhere around there anyhow
<Xavier> I got through the whole thing then tried the next level of diff and just gave up
<Xavier> Sg/Sirius, you guys in the forums yet?
<Xavier> well we know Sirius is
<Xavier> duh
<Xavier> SG then
<Sirius> yeah, I killed the open forums
<SG_01> "You have specified an incorrect or inactive username, or an invalid password.
<SG_01> "
<SG_01> Did you get me active yet?
<Xavier> there you go
<Xavier> k make sure you can see the WIki content now
<Xavier> you too Sirius
<Sirius> ok
<SG_01> Do I need to register on it?
<Xavier> nope, you shold be set
<Sirius> which username/password set is it for it?
<Sirius> same as site or 
<Sirius> um
<Sirius> SVN?
<SG_01> Both of those are giving me an invalid user/password thingy
<Xavier> ok you should have an email
<SG_01> Hrmm, not yet, but I'll give it a min
<Xavier> go to the wiki and do forgot-my-assword
<Xavier> *password
<SG_01> Alright, got it
<Xavier> :)
* Taos sets mode: +o Xavier
<SG_01> Does Ogre use that NVidia Cg library or something?
<Xavier> their CgProgramManager plugin uses it
<SG_01> Ah
<Xavier> but since HLSL is basically Cg, and HLSL is supported by both nv and ATI, it's become the de facto 
  standard for shader langs
<Xavier> I don't build it as part of the engine code, I don't think
<Xavier> if I do it can be turned off in the Configuration Manager in VS.NET
<Xavier> Sirius, did we determine whetehr you had VS or not?
<Sirius> I don't have the IDE, no
<Sirius> I do have the rest of the tools, I believe...
<Xavier> including C#?
<Sirius> unless .NET 1.1 is out of date
<Sirius> yes
<[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> later ppl i'll see ya round ... dont be afraid to drop into the CDT forum and have yer say!
* [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng has quit IRC (Quit: )
<Xavier> nope, 1.1 is still the standard
<Xavier> 2.0 won't come out until the next Windows
<Sirius> right
<SG_01> 2.0 is nice for web stuff, but it's not the standard jsut yet :P
<Xavier> hell, I think Mono will hve 2.0 support before windows does
<SG_01> hehe
* SG_01 is now known as SG_01`Zzz
<Xavier> alright guys, I will copy this log and make it available via SVN (probably in the docs/ directory)
<Sirius> k
<Xavier> oh btw, I will be putting things on the site instead of int he Wiki from now on, and the latest info 
  will always be on the site (so some thigns in the Wiki will be superseded)
<Xavier> including the SVN directory structure and what and where and why
<Taos> Xavier, I'll be home during the day most of this coming week and do some migration for you
