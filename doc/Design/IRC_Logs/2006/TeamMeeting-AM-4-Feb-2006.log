RedSpace so how are things going in the programming side?
Xavier just about wrapping up this milestone I think
RedSpace cool stuff
Xavier can't really think of anything else we need to do for it -- have control of the model with all three input types (key, mouse, stick) -- it moves around obeying adjustable parameters (limits, accelerations etc)
RedSpace did you get the torso twist working?
Xavier we can choose missions and models at runtime (that was an extra for this milestone)
Xavier that is what I wan to ttalk to Eli about
Xavier wanna see if we can break that in the hierarchy during modelling
Xavier we have a workaround for it but it's kinda kludgy and wastefull (in memory), since it keeps two copies of the same skeleton around to work
RedSpace model construction is something we need to nail down for sure
RedSpace esp silly things like how do we do tank tracks?
RedSpace will it be a solid piece, but with an animated tex?
RedSpace 'cause i'llneed to know that sort of thing when i leave the concept model behind and work on the game model
Xavier there is a whole thread on tank tracks in the Ogre forums -- it's not straightforward, for sure
Xavier I think that's the general consensus - animated texture
Xavier with normal and displacement maps it can be made to look very realistic yet still be compuatationally inexpensive
RedSpace that's certainly the name of the game
Xavier yup...altho with the ability of vertex animation in Ogre now, it could be done that the tracks simply animate in three keyframes too...the biggest issue is how the hell to do that in the modelling tool ;)
Xavier altho I'll bet there is a method of using path control on the track vertices to make it simpler to create the keyframes
Xavier I need to know if Rixeh is still around...haven't heard from him in a while -- he was supposed to be doing an infantry model, but then there's been nothing since the first night
Xavier lol
Xavier Eli should be here any second
Xavier heh I guess I should have given some advance notice, more than just the day before, about this early meeting ;)
Xavier then again, I didn't decide on it until yesterday...
* All_for_One (all_for_on@nbt-7455BA1.bchsia.telus.net) has joined #cos-dev
Xavier yo
Xavier up early ;)
* Elisor (elisor@85D61D5.6F48E85D.631212C1.IP) has joined #cos-dev
Xavier afternoon, Eli :)
Elisor yo :)  is the first meeting now?
Xavier aye
Elisor oki doki.  afk 1 min
Xavier np...Redspace brought up a couple of good questions: tank track animation, and also asked about the torso twist
All_for_One just up
All_for_One I know UT2k4's tank tread animation is texture panning
Xavier on the first one, I wanted your opinion -- animated textures or actual vertex animations, are two of the options, can you think of anything else?
All_for_One From playing around on LM's BF maps in BAs, I think W4
All_for_One *MW4's are as well
Elisor would think it would be easier with tex animation.  off hand I can't think of any other way
Xavier that seems to be the standard way of doing it, ya -- with some good normal/displacement maps it can look good
Xavier k, well I guess that answers that ;)
Xavier next one: Eli, is there a way to be able to break the dependency chain on the skeleton during animation such that the whole skeleton does not rotate when the torso twists?
Elisor Yes, just break the chain.  I'll check it now while we're talking.  But I do remember something in the exporter documentation warning about breaking chains
Xavier hmm...does it export different skeletons if you do that, or something similar?
Xavier we can break it during the loading by not sharing the skeleton between the torso and the main model, but then we have two copies of the same skeleton running around, which I was trying to avoid -- I suppose I could lop off the unused bones in each if it became an issue, but I wanted to find out first if there was an alternate way of doing it
All_for_One How does mw4 do it?
Elisor just one thing, the whole skeleton doens't move when you move the torso.  it's when you move the pelvis it all moves
Xavier not a clue, but they aren't using Ogre either so I couldn't even begin to speculate on MW4's methods
Xavier hmm...when we load the top part, which doesn't include the pelvis, and turn its node, the whole thing turns...if you rotate the upper spine in Max, the rest of the model doesn't move?
Elisor no, if you move the spine in MAX just the spine/arms move
Xavier hmm
Elisor I've got MAX open now testing it to make sure
Elisor it's not even the pelvis, it's the BIPED01 object that moves the whole thing
Elisor if you open up one of the MAX files and select the Bip01 object, that's teh only one that'll move the whole skeleton
* Elisor AFO plz look at your other windows
Xavier looks like I get to investigate some .xml files ;)
Xavier oh while I'm thinking about it, yes, I have not forgotten about fixing up the maxscript exporter to make your life easier ;)
Elisor cool :)
Xavier AFO, question for you: what factions will we be using for the internal alpha?
Xavier one or more?
All_for_One internal alpha?
Xavier and do we have a complete set of "things" selected for use in the mission in that alpha?
Xavier ya, the timeline has a first internal alpha release set for later this year
Xavier likely Dec 2006
Xavier that alpha will be a single mission on a single map involving a consistent set of completed models
Xavier the first full game in other words -- even if it is just a single mission/map with a limited set of models
All_for_One sorry,  I don't know, Heng is dealing with that part IIRC
Xavier k
Xavier on the programming front, we're just about done with this milestone
Xavier we've got autopatching (a bit buggered right now, I'm working on that presently)
Xavier got control of a model in the engine using all forms of input (mouse, keyboard, stick)
Xavier we can select "mission" and "model" at launch
Xavier so for the next few days it'll be cleanup and bugfixing on this milestone and development will begin on the features for the next one
All_for_One though on the map thing I think heng has a thread up dealing with hypothetical map scenarios
Xavier aye, but at some point someone needs to begin actually creating a terrain/landscape/level
Xavier not sure which of our modellers is most keen on that
All_for_One could we use RL greyscale satellite pic?
Xavier we could try and see how it turns out -- it needs to be N^2+1 x N^2+1
Xavier and 8- or 16-bit greyscale
Xavier the texture(s) that go on it are of course a different matter
All_for_One I know it worked in MW4 in MP3 on that titan base map
Xavier and even then, there are any number of different things we can do to the terrain texture
Xavier k
All_for_One it's heightmap is one of the actual pics of titan
Xavier well then it works in Ogre because that Canyon map I got from Lynx directly out of some MW4 extract
All_for_One could we maybe go pester Ash if he'd like to whip us up something?
Xavier might want to run that by DP and Taos first; is Ash still even remotely involved?
All_for_One don't think so
All_for_One or just maybe get someone in the mw4 world to do it for us and for mw4.
Xavier real quick on the development milestones - I think I will swap the featureset for 0.3 and 0.4 milestones a bit...0.3 should have networked multiplayer support and scripting, and audio support pushed off to 0.4
Xavier I think we can find someone internally to do it
Xavier the easy part is the heightmap
All_for_One yeah
RedSpace Magnus is pretty hot with map creation isn't he?
Xavier the hard part is a good looking texture
All_for_One yes
All_for_One he's behind the BF maps and everything you see in them
All_for_One and most of the other maps in MP3
Xavier the main thing is that it follows the theme of whichever planet we've selected (Haven?)
Xavier pick one zone, one section, and do it right
RedSpace it strikes me it would be good to get him involved with the project
All_for_One jeho did titan base and that deathmatch-but-really-a-TKOTH map
All_for_One he
All_for_One is heavily in mektek, but no harm trying
Xavier hmm I'd rather not bring in someone with that strong a relationship with an agency that seems to be biased against the project simply because of its relationship to DP
Xavier I think we can probably homegrow the talent, honestly
Xavier again, the heightmap is easy, the texures are a big 2-D project more than anything
All_for_One I'll ask anyways
RedSpace so we'd be more interested in gaining some more 2d artists?
Xavier Eli, on the Scorpion, you said you had a new animation? was it exported and committed yet?
Xavier RedSpace: one good one would be nice
Elisor no reason you can't take an existing grey-scale and tex satellite map of part of the earth and use that
Elisor no, I said I'd do a new one ;)  havne't had time to work on it yet
Xavier k
RedSpace @X: Godhammer seems to be quite good
RedSpace he created a nice texture for his mech in HC
Elisor AFO, would you expect both legs on each side to move at the same time?  the alternative is to have the front legs then the back.  would give almost a rabbit kind of movement
Xavier RedSpace: feel free to ask him ;)
RedSpace rgr
All_for_One legs across from each other and on the same side would be opposite to each other
Elisor so diagonal legs would move together?
All_for_One so like RF, LR, LF RR
RedSpace that would be logical
Elisor ok, cos that's how it moves now
All_for_One dunno, I'm getting that error you are
Elisor but it's a very jerky, awkward movement
* All_for_One pokes xav
Elisor dl that file I mentioned in the other window and then you can look at the source MAX file in the SVN
All_for_One k
Xavier I know I know...I'm working on one other thing I forgot to mention for 0.2....a progress window that shows you what files are being downloaded ;)
Xavier and also trying to figure out what borked the download process as well...
Elisor weird was when I was downloading those "zip" files a few days ago I'm sure they were 600+ kb.  The ones I dl'd and don't work were 200+ Kb
Xavier oh and Eli...we'll need several animations for each model, of course....MACROs will have not only the startup and walk, but also "stamping of feet" for while they are turning, something for in-air movements while jumping, a landing animation for after the jump...and not sure what to do for falling/exploding/etc
Xavier they are different sizes
Xavier kana is 600k
Xavier scorp is 200k
Elisor nuderstood.  do you have a categorical list of anims that are needed for each model?
Xavier shogun is 1.4M
Xavier er
Xavier 1.0M
Xavier tbolt is 2.1M
Xavier mostly depends on the textures involved...I'm going to have to start removing those to a central location (the textures.zip file) so that they dont' clash when loading
Xavier um, not yet
Xavier we'll go over this again tonight and brainstorm on that list -- right now that's all I coudl think of
Xavier and that's just for MACROs ;)
Xavier infantry models are another story
Xavier oh, and little things like missle flaps that open --- plan on doing those as vertex animations, not skeletal
Xavier we'll just blend the two at runtime
Elisor k.  I'd like to get to get one model completely animated start to finish.  prolly the Kana cos that's just sooooooooooo damn cute
Xavier hehe yup :)
Xavier and the texture looks really good
Xavier even if it is a MW4 model :p
Elisor would like to do the Engel.  Having the soldier in there + the dangly bits gives a lot of artistic licence
Xavier which is that?
All_for_One the one with the wing-things
Xavier ours? 
Elisor yeah it's one of AFO's concepts
* Xavier confesses to not having kept up on all the concepts as they go whizzing by ;)
Elisor just having problems with normals on AFOs models :P
Xavier kewl...the more of our own stuff the better obviously ;)
All_for_One http://www.clashofsteel.net/all_for_one/engel3.jpg
Elisor he's got some juicy concepts, it's just getting them properly normalled that's taking time.  
All_for_One though I've since gotten rid of the forward/top gun/wing
* Elisor nudges AFO to try max :P
Xavier what do you use AFO?
All_for_One rhino
RedSpace that should be a interesting challenge to animate Eli
Xavier two-sided polys, eh? ;)
All_for_One yes
All_for_One though I can check the normals and flip them one at a time
* Xavier points to the Modellers' Guide on two-sided normals :p
Xavier er\
Elisor _really_ looking forward to it Redspace.  it'd look phrickin excellent animated
Xavier two-sdied polys
RedSpace would a 2 sided normal be abnormal?
Xavier lol
All_for_One games only use on-sided
Elisor I've tried DeepEx and MAX to sort out the normals.  deepex sorted out the Shogun, but didn't sort out the other three
All_for_One *one-sided
Elisor had to make the Shogun double-sided
Xavier Blender did a bang-up job on sorting the normals and two-sided
RedSpace it certainly sorted out my trebuchet model out
Xavier for shadowing reasons we don't want two-sided polys
RedSpace did you get any further with your experiments with that model Xav?
Xavier Eli, you shouldn't have to deal with it -- the models are supposed to come to you already cleaned up
Xavier no, I think I am going to have taos lean on Lupus to use ZBrush to do it
Elisor I know, but I wanted to play with AFO's concepts so took the time to try to import them.  told ya I thought they were juicy ;)
Xavier but then I have not had a chance since then to try any of the other tools -- been busy with this other stuff :(
Xavier lol k
* Xavier puts normal mapping on the nearterm to-do list
Xavier I have your model and the rifle of AC's to work with
Elisor do you need any other animated models, or should I concentrate on the ones that've been done and get them totally animated?
Xavier RedSpace, is your Terb ready for animation?
Xavier *Treb
Xavier eli: so far this is still prototyping -- probably we'll go ahead and sort out the complete list of animations needed (as well as the speed factors to use for the length of each animation), something we'll do hopefully tonigiht
Xavier actually, we can just put a static number on the stride-length I think
Xavier I'll just scale it at runtime to match the model's top speed
* Xavier makes another note to get the model params from script so that the designers can tweak that stuff at runtime without rebuilding
Xavier so basically, Eli, we'll continue refining the animations we have and figuring out which ones we need
Xavier RedSpace, is the Treb ready for animation?
Elisor oki doki.  when we can see the work in-game as well it'll give better feedback on changing the anim
Xavier right
* Xavier makes another note to provide a small tool to create .cos model files ;)
Xavier that one I already have in progress tho
Xavier I still am working on this CDK, but it's slow going with everything else that needs to be done :(
Xavier I need two more goo dprogrammers :(
Xavier anything else we need to talk about? anyone have any questions about the state of the project or the roadmap?
Xavier Eli, you had asked about the cinematic trailer...that will rely on completion of the internal alpha at least, for in-game shots
Xavier as for standard film-level CG, that can be done at any time but we need a storyboard first, something I don't expect to start considering for a few months yet
RedSpace @ Xav: I've just checked the Treb, all 2 sided polys have been delt with and it's textured, just not fantastically
Xavier so long as it's got at least one level of UV coords, it's better than plastic Phong shading ;)
Xavier the texture can be fixed later
Elisor oki doki Xav
Xavier go ahead and drop that in your folder in SVN, Red, and Eli can pick it up from there -- format is .blend?
Xavier actually, just export it to .obj and .mtl
Xavier Lightwave that is
Xavier Eli can import those
Elisor sure
Elisor you're usingn Lightwave, Redspace?
Xavier thought he was using Blender
RedSpace Wings
Xavier ah that's right
Xavier but I am guessing the best interchange format right now is still Lightwave .obj/.mtl
Elisor plz export it as a .obj plz along with the tex
RedSpace rgr
Xavier drop those in your SVN folder
Xavier Eli, do you want to be on the SVN email list? you'll get all of the programming commit messages, but you can also see when stuff is added to the models/ folders
Elisor sure
Xavier k
Elisor elisor@clashofsteel.net ;)
Xavier aye :)
Xavier k, anyone have any questions or comments?
Elisor nope
RedSpace where's the donuts?
Xavier lol
Xavier then I'll compile this into notes for tonight's meeting and build a set of minutes from both meetings :)
RedSpace Eli: Treb.zip is the file u want
Xavier next month I'll be sure to announce this early one well in advance so that we can get a bit higher attendance ;)
Elisor oki doke's is it in the svn?
RedSpace Any extra ideas to improve the AA tank?
RedSpace yes
All_for_One looks good
RedSpace are you using the size for lasers as a moddeling guide or in game too?
All_for_One both
Xavier excellent, thanks everyone for coming, even if it was a lower turnout than I hoped, we covered some good items -- like I said next time I expect to have more of us here at this hour (maybe even DP for a change ;)
All_for_One http://www.clashofsteel.net/all_for_one/cosspeeds2.xls if you want to play around in that mess of a sheet
Xavier (not trying to cut you off, sorry :( )
All_for_One that is everything I have thus far
