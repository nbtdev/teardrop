[23:14:05] <~Xavier> ========================== LOG CUT LINE ==========================
[23:14:25] <~Xavier> artists, those who are here: let's go over what each of you are working on and the state that it is in
[23:14:28] <~Xavier> Rixeh?
[23:15:10] <Rixeh> <stands> Hi, Im rixeh and Im a alcoholic..er..animator.. I'm doing the Hurricane Macro right now (model by AllForOne)..
[23:15:33] <Rixeh> Rigging done, walkcycle done, adding run/crouch/hit/powerup-down/etc animations soon Smile
[23:15:47] <~Xavier> xlnt Smile Red?
[23:17:26] <~Xavier> or if he is AFK then Thoth?
[23:17:54] * [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng slaps RedSpace around a bit with a large trout
[23:17:56] <RedSpace> Got a un factioned walker and heavy tank in concept stage as well as a mix tech transport. Sandstorm is with Thoth or ideas and the Sol Fat Bastard is in mothball currently
[23:18:16] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> that tank is looking good dude Smile
[23:18:28] <RedSpace> somewhat hung over, and majorly tired.. can't type too fast
[23:18:36] <~Xavier> lol
[23:18:37] <Thoth> Razz
[23:19:17] <~Xavier> Thoth, what you got and what state is it in ?
[23:19:41] <Thoth> nothing new to report... true to form i am behind.
[23:19:56] <Thoth> I am trying hard to set aside time
[23:20:01] <~Xavier> rgr
[23:20:09] <~Xavier> Side?
[23:21:04] <Sidelink> still working on a micro, haven't had much time due to work, this is what it looks like at the moment http://www.clashofsteel.net/sidelink/images/microconcept2.jpg
[23:21:28] <Sidelink> it's all gohan fault, just because it is
[23:21:33] <Gohan> D:
[23:21:38] <~Xavier> rofl
[23:21:47] <~Xavier> and DH, how's that map coming?
[23:21:48] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> a reasonable conclusion.
[23:23:37] * Thoth braces for Xavier's ire
[23:23:43] <Thoth> Smile
[23:23:46] * [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng pokes DH
[23:24:15] * [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng gives Darkhorse a wedgie
[23:24:40] <Darkhorse> xavier - still got buildings to do
[23:24:52] *** Thoth changed nick to Thoth|afk
[23:25:10] <~Xavier> can you get me the heightfield and textures tho?
[23:25:24] <~Xavier> and also, you aren't making buildings part of the map mesh are you?
[23:25:26] <Darkhorse> yeah, they're uploaded
[23:25:36] <Darkhorse> preferably not
[23:26:01] <~Xavier> aye, they would get placed (possibly in Max, more likely in something like Sketchup)
[23:26:05] <Sirius> heightmap buildings usually suck
[23:26:31] <Darkhorse> wouldn't be terrain buildings, they're individual meshes
[23:26:40] <~Xavier> good....k so on your FTP space what would I be looking for?
[23:26:53] <Darkhorse> other thing is it's going to need a water plane jammed through it for the river
[23:27:10] <~Xavier> I can grab it and work on getting it in the game tomorrow
[23:27:14] <Darkhorse> checking
[23:27:33] <~Xavier> will the map work with a single water plane for the whole thing, or are there different water levels (i.e. ponds at different elevations)?
[23:27:42] <Darkhorse> one water plane
[23:28:08] <Darkhorse> the concept just had a river through it. ponds is a good idea though
[23:28:42] <Darkhorse> http://www.clashofsteel.net/darkhorse/Mission-7_terrain.zip
[23:29:06] <~Xavier> kewl
[23:30:15] <~Xavier> so, what I am stuck on right now is trying to figure out how I am supposed to get proper texture coordinates out of Max -- the Max exporter is what I am working on in other words
[23:31:11] <~Xavier> when I figure that out I can then put together an actual CoS exporter which will allow the artists to export (initially from Max, but shortly after from Maya) directly to a loadable format which they can use to check their stuff in the game
[23:31:25] <~Xavier> I am hoping to get that done by the 15th
[23:31:30] <~Xavier> for both Max and Maya
[23:32:30] <Rixeh> sweet Smile
[23:32:33] <~Xavier> in the meantime, use the Ogre XML exporters and check your .mesh.xml, .skeleton.xml (if applicable) and .material files, as well as your original source files (.max, .mb, etc) and any textures used into SVN in the katana/models/<your name> folder
[23:32:59] <~Xavier> I'll have to create the .cos model files by hand (or figure out a way to do it via web page or something) in the meantime
[23:33:42] <ToxicSoul> http://misc.amplifythesound.org/Mission-7.png
[23:33:53] <ToxicSoul> link could be wrong I forget what I uploaded it as
[23:34:02] <~Xavier> SG I believe is back in action and working on scripting support -- both for GUI scripting and also for mission scripting
[23:34:33] <Darkhorse> that's correct tox
[23:35:08] <~Xavier> Slit, when you get back let me know what your status is
[23:35:37] <~Xavier> and Tox and Sirius are still in learning-the-design mode right now -- Tox is also busy keeping the site running Wink
[23:35:50] <ToxicSoul> I wish xav
[23:35:54] *** Thoth|afk changed nick to Thoth
[23:35:55] * ToxicSoul pokes DP on that one
[23:36:02] <~Xavier> lol tox
[23:36:15] <~Xavier> Asmu, any signficant happenings in Design?
[23:36:18] <Sirius> they need to make a Java exception type called "up"
[23:36:46] <~Xavier> hehe
[23:36:48] <Sirius> public Object aMethod() throws up { ... }
[23:36:53] <~Xavier> rofl
[23:37:00] <ToxicSoul> Xav I may consider turning AFO's spreadsheet (with lots of help from him.. I can't understand it =p) into a tool but it may be above me in C++, so would it matter if it was in another language or not
[23:37:20] <~Xavier> probably not -- if it were web-based PHP would be fine
[23:37:21] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> in design as applies to game mechanics or art?
[23:37:33] <ToxicSoul> Well I was thinking delphi, but okay =p
[23:37:43] <~Xavier> mechanics probably -- art would just be minor tweaks at this point I would assume
[23:37:52] <~Xavier> or Delphi, if you want
[23:37:59] <ToxicSoul> I should force myself to do C++ any way /me shuts up now
[23:38:05] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> we had an interestin discussion yesterday about infantry (again)
[23:38:13] <Gohan> Wink
[23:38:18] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> and whether people would find it fun to be a squichy
[23:38:23] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> or if we need to add more incentives
[23:38:44] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> we thought we might put up a discussion thread in the open forums asking for peoples input
[23:38:55] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> might do that when we do the Q&A sessions
[23:38:57] <~Xavier> not a bad idea
[23:39:16] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> we thought some sort of rewards system for infantry only might make it more fun
[23:39:29] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> gaining ranks in each seperate game or set of games
[23:39:43] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> so dedicated infantry players might get a few cute bonuses the more they play
[23:40:04] <Gohan> not cute Wink
[23:40:09] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> however in a combined arms game inf are gonna be squishy unless we overpower them so i think people have gota accept death as infantry
[23:40:13] <Gohan> it makes the player more effective
[23:40:16] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> well as in not overpowering
[23:40:29] <Darkhorse> kawaii
[23:40:37] <Gohan> gb2furry
[23:40:40] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> then we try to tailor the upgrades to a class by class basis
[23:40:47] <Gohan> yes
[23:40:47] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> play a scout alot and you will get extra scouting abilities etc
[23:41:02] <ToxicSoul> well bf2142 is supposed to be creating something where if you play as squads the longer you're there the more bonus features you get.
[23:41:06] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> however this is something we can plug in later if it is nessesary or liked i feel
[23:41:09] <ToxicSoul> in the game, not stats.
[23:41:20] <~Xavier> interesting -- this would be in general public mode?
[23:41:23] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> yes i read something fo that sort
[23:41:31] <ToxicSoul> to me? yes
[23:41:42] <Gohan> I drew the idea from RtCW: Enemy Territory
[23:42:02] <Gohan> but as that game was completely about infantry, it may need to be altered here
[23:42:05] <ToxicSoul> say your in a squad that has x points, or existed for x ammount of time, you may get a UAV, or Supply drop feature for your squad
[23:42:51] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> such features are undefined at this point but the concept might work ... but its something we need to be careful about and i would like some comunity feedback too
[23:43:04] <~Xavier> I still am not sure that I see infantry when MACROs are on the field, as being more than small SpecOps units
[23:43:11] <Darkhorse> infantry just need a role that is exceedingly useful
[23:43:20] <Darkhorse> like, capturing points 3x faster
[23:43:57] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> onl infantry can cap points
[23:44:04] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> pretty much all objective based stuff need inf
[23:44:06] <Darkhorse> or that
[23:44:10] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> or MICROs dependiong on map design
[23:44:20] <~Xavier> good point
[23:44:21] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> some maps will be MICRO only because of no atmosphere etc
[23:44:27] <Darkhorse> I want an ice burn spell. Very Happy
[23:44:33] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> some maps will be mroe inf based than others
[23:44:37] <Gohan> this is not final fantasy!
[23:44:47] <~Xavier> FF( ftw
[23:44:50] <Gohan> besides, you have no magic points, and no gil to buy ether
[23:44:51] <Darkhorse> it is to me!
[23:45:00] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> however in more balanced maps wheer inf an larger vehicle interact we indeed need to make sure inf dont feel useless
[23:45:11] <~Xavier> aye
[23:45:18] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> but inf death means little in terms of attrition just time wasted
[23:45:40] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> also the number of ways inf can get back into the fight is quite large compared to vehicles so i hope that helps too
[23:45:43] <RedSpace> but DH.. if we ive you the ice burn spell, it means we have to give anch his amazons
[23:45:47] <~Xavier> that's where APCs come in handy -- get the inf to where they are useful saffely
[23:46:02] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> however its a fun factor thing which needs some input so we are holding til we do soem research from the community
[23:46:06] <RedSpace> sigh. i can't type anymore
[23:46:07] <Darkhorse> no, I'll survive without it
[23:46:16] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> APCs ... small inf only spawn points
[23:46:17] <Darkhorse> I was thinking a water ele spell in GW anyway :p
[23:46:22] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> drop pods
[23:46:28] <Gohan> (GW is fail)
[23:46:30] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> various transports really
[23:46:39] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i thought you were a GW fan G
[23:46:45] <Gohan> I quit a long time ago
[23:46:58] <Darkhorse> now he just plays hookey
[23:47:01] <~Xavier> wish Anch were here to give an update on his inf model -- anyone know where he is on that?
[23:47:01] <Gohan> too much work, not enough interest
[23:47:16] <DarkPhoenix> hold one, I have info on that one
[23:47:20] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> not sure Xav he was having trouble with joints last i heard
[23:47:47] <DarkPhoenix> I'm also working feverishly on my CoS infantry model. This is proving to be quite challenging, since I want the limbs to bend properly and I'd like to set up the rig so that the eyes, mouth, tongue, neck, fingers and feet all bend properly. Obviously I'd like to have the major joints working also. Once I get one made it can be used for all infantry in the game, since we can mix and match armor on it. I want to make the figure proper
[23:47:47] <DarkPhoenix> If this model can be set up properly it could even be used for animation/ in-game films. I want it to be able to talk. Most new games have beginning movies where the characters act and describe plot twists, etc. Have a look at the beginning movie for Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends, for example, and you'll see what I mean. Or The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. The public expects this kind of attention to detail now.
[23:47:47] <DarkPhoenix> I have made substantial progress on the model since my last posted images, but I still may not have it ready for the August 15 release.
[23:47:52] <DarkPhoenix> end
[23:48:25] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> getting lunch brb
[23:48:30] <Darkhorse> Oblivion's lip-sync is barely even realistic, looks like they have botox in their lips.
[23:48:37] <~Xavier> lol
[23:48:48] <ToxicSoul> lol yeah..
[23:48:59] <Gohan> unless we are going to have a lot of cinematics, omega attention to realistic lip movement is not a high priority, IMO
[23:49:09] <Gohan> this is not Mass Effect
[23:49:11] <~Xavier> Ogre has support for vertex pose animation now so we can blend realistic facial animation in with skeletal animation
[23:49:32] <~Xavier> for a first alpha, I agree Gohan -- it can always be retrofitted
[23:49:51] <~Xavier> lip-synch requires a phonetic design tool tho
[23:50:32] <Darkhorse> and it doesn't really add anything to the game
[23:50:34] <~Xavier> something that can take a text speech and grab the phonemes from it and match facial pose blends to the phoneme
[23:50:59] <~Xavier> no, but it depends on whether we want HiFi cinematics or not
[23:51:14] <~Xavier> again, tho, it's not for right now anyway
[23:51:27] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> the game is more about multiplayer fighting not single player nor cinematics .. it can be a backburner thing
[23:51:32] <~Xavier> yup
[23:51:41] <~Xavier> it's not a tool I plan to create right now anyway Wink
[23:52:52] <~Xavier> I may actually whip up something quick that will create a .cos file using the OgreXMLConverter on the artist's machine to generate files they can load in-game
[23:53:23] <~Xavier> that would make more sense than me having to do them by hand
[23:54:34] * [HJ]-Asmudius_Heng nods
[23:54:43] <~Xavier> so I suppose at this point we just keep on moving forward -- I'll spend tonight adminstering a smackdown to the Max exporter and then work on the map tomorrow
[23:55:22] <~Xavier> DH keeps working on buildings -- if I have any luck with getting the map into Sketchup I'll get with him so he can do some test placements
[23:55:27] <Darkhorse> one of the buildings is going to cut into the terrain by the way - how's that going to work?
[23:55:57] <~Xavier> I'll also have the designers get familiar with Sketchup and the content creation process, since it's you guys that will be making and laying out the levels Wink
[23:56:03] <~Xavier> it should be fine, DH
[23:56:05] <ToxicSoul> I sort of like how MW4 managed map creation to be honest as far as tools go.
[23:56:17] <ToxicSoul> A little tech update to that sort of idea would be nice
[23:56:22] <~Xavier> it's the same thing
[23:56:24] <Darkhorse> MW4 is pretty dodgy compared to others.
[23:56:34] <ToxicSoul> yeah just sort of spread out it seems
[23:56:35] <~Xavier> it's a tool that lets you puts things on a heightfield
[23:56:48] <~Xavier> same as the MW mission editor
[23:56:57] <Gohan> sketchup is cool
[23:56:58] <~Xavier> they are all the same concept, no matter what engine you use
[23:57:30] <~Xavier> our CTO at work knows two guys working on the next HL episode and says they are using Sketchup for the level design there, it's that good for it
[23:57:51] <Gohan> yeah, it is supremely easy to use
[23:58:11] <~Xavier> the only thing I might have to work up is an Ogre .mesh importer
[23:58:19] <~Xavier> unless there is one already
[23:59:23] <~Xavier> I do not mind at all saying to the modders (and the designers, of course) "use Sketchup for CoS level design, and here is how you use it to generate CoS loadable levels"
[23:59:43] <~Xavier> it falls right in line with my desperate hatred of reinventing wheels
[00:00:01] <~Xavier> if Sketchup fits our needs, in other words, then *bingo* there's our CoS level design tool Wink
[00:00:08] <~Xavier> it's 100% FOC
[00:00:18] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> FOC?
[00:00:22] <~Xavier> free of charge
[00:00:29] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> sounds good to me
[00:00:37] <~Xavier> sketchup.google.com
[00:00:52] <Thoth> i can see it as a starting point, you can export from it but i cant see it as the actual designer
[00:00:55] <RedSpace> is there anything more you need me for? really needing some sleep about now
[00:01:05] <Gohan> I used it to create a model replica of the house I stayed in while I was in Mexico. Tutorials are win.
[00:01:09] <~Xavier> np Red, that's probably it
[00:01:17] <Thoth> yes, it creates well and fast
[00:01:17] <RedSpace> rgr. morning all.
[00:01:20] <Thoth> but tweaking
[00:01:24] <Thoth> later Redspace
[00:01:31] <Thoth> and surfacing
[00:01:38] <Thoth> not so much
[00:01:41] *** RedSpace quit (Connection reset by peer)
[00:01:49] <~Xavier> thoth: it is being used to create levels for a AAA game -- it must work for their needs
[00:01:58] <~Xavier> I don't expect any surfacing to be needed
[00:02:02] * Thoth surprised
[00:02:06] <~Xavier> designers are not going to be textureing
[00:02:38] <Thoth> k, you guys know the business, I am just surprised
[00:03:07] * Thoth downloads now
[00:05:15] <~Xavier> and if it turns out not to be what we need, then we'll punt
[00:06:20] <Thoth> hey if top developers are using it, who am i to say Razz
[00:06:53] <Gohan> if it fails to meet your needs, then you say Razz
[00:08:10] <Thoth> lol, my needs right now cant be met by software Sad
[00:08:16] <~Xavier> hehe
[00:08:22] <~Xavier> btw did you ever get Ultimapper figured out?
[00:09:02] <~Xavier> and Rixeh, how many tex maps do you have on that model?
[00:12:07] <Thoth> my LW dongle driver breaks my XSI install Xav
[00:12:27] <~Xavier> !!
[00:12:35] <Thoth> Ultimapper is beyond reach atm
[00:12:41] <~Xavier> I'd slap LW around for that
[00:12:47] <Thoth> neg
[00:12:50] <Thoth> i didnt pay for XSI
[00:12:53] <~Xavier> ahh
[00:13:01] <Thoth> Wink
[00:13:59] <Thoth> LW 9 was released a little over a week ago. Normal mapping is fully working in it, but there is still no generator
[00:14:31] <Thoth> I will provision my desktop for XSI and clear out all Lightwave stuff
[00:14:55] <Rixeh> Oops sry back
[00:15:00] <~Xavier> only if you want -- I wouldn't do it just for CoS' Wink
[00:15:04] <Rixeh> which model xav?
[00:15:19] <~Xavier> hurricane (the AVI of which I cannot download because your site hates me)
[00:15:24] <Rixeh> aw
[00:15:31] <Thoth> ill do it to use a higher end app
[00:15:34] <Rixeh> just 1 map.. its a game model Wink
[00:15:52] <Rixeh> havent textured it yet though, its got a placeholder texture
[00:15:58] <~Xavier> ahh k
[00:16:16] <Rixeh> I will soon though, but the UVs are layed out so it can get passed off
[00:16:24] <Rixeh> to somone else if necessary
[00:17:29] <~Xavier> hmm do we have a texturing specialist in the house?
[00:18:05] * ~Xavier flips off the "Waiting for www.distant-sun.net" status line in his browser...
[00:18:12] <Rixeh> omg sux
[00:18:25] <Rixeh> WTF! the whole site is down?
[00:18:51] <Rixeh> Im really starting to hate this host.. it got bought out by someone else and service went to shit
[00:19:33] <~Xavier> host with DP :p
[00:19:38] <DarkPhoenix> Smile
[00:19:41] <Rixeh> hehe
[00:19:53] <Rixeh> ANYWAY. Once it comes back up hopefully you can get that avi
[00:19:57] <~Xavier> I'd offer my server too but there is no telling when I might decide to stop having it Wink
[00:20:22] <ToxicSoul> Or if we had someone to do web stuff he could have a CoS account......................................................................
[00:20:23] <ToxicSoul> lol
[00:20:32] <Rixeh> no prob, i have no idea how the model will work ingame or if the scale is right
[00:20:48] <Gohan> geocities is win *runs*
[00:20:49] <~Xavier> if you assumed 1unit = 1m then it should be fine
[00:21:00] <Rixeh> ok well then it might actually be ok
[00:21:03] <~Xavier> goecities is t3h suq
[00:21:22] <Rixeh> I wouldnt mind having a list of typical animations though.. so they can all have the same movements
[00:21:23] <Thoth> www.bluehost.com
[00:21:35] <Gohan> is there a redhost.com
[00:21:57] <Thoth> shell access on LAMP
[00:22:10] * ~Xavier puts the standard animation names creation on TODO
[00:22:12] <ToxicSoul> Walk, Run, Jump,
[00:22:14] <ToxicSoul> =D
[00:22:18] <Rixeh> jump? Wink
[00:22:18] <ToxicSoul> Prone
[00:22:24] <ToxicSoul> Yes for infantry
[00:22:26] <ToxicSoul> =D
[00:22:28] <Rixeh> Ok for MACROs then Wink
[00:22:31] <ToxicSoul> roll
[00:22:35] <ToxicSoul> oh
[00:22:38] <ToxicSoul> fine. =(
[00:22:39] <Rixeh> Jump may still be applicable though
[00:22:50] *** Xavier quit (Connection reset by peer)
[00:22:51] <Rixeh> Crouch I wanna add too, like mw4
[00:22:54] * Thoth thinks of Gir
[00:22:55] <ToxicSoul> I was just imagining myself dolphine diving in BF2.
[00:23:00] <Thoth> can we have it make a sandwich
[00:23:06] <Rixeh> ...... Yes.
[00:23:15] <Rixeh> and chicken-dance
[00:23:20] <Thoth> awesome
[00:23:26] <Rixeh> \o/
[00:24:23] <Rixeh> I'm thinking at least: Walk, Run, Crouch, Jumpjet(?), Hit(Upper), Hit(Lower), Shoot, Powerup, Powerdown..
[00:24:38] <ToxicSoul> Turn!
[00:24:43] <ToxicSoul> Torsotwise
[00:24:51] <Rixeh> Twists actually..hmm

[00:25:22] <Rixeh> er, should the upper/lower torsos be 2 meshes?

[00:25:45] *** ChanServ sets channel #cos-dev mode +oq Xavier Xavier
[00:25:50] <Rixeh> Doh
[00:25:52] <~Xavier> *sigh*
[00:25:53] <ToxicSoul> should all be multiple meshes combined by one skeletal system imo
[00:25:55] <Gohan> for inf, reloading, switching weapons (which really means needlessly cocking a weapon), and climbing
[00:25:58] <~Xavier> managed to lock up Linux
[00:26:00] <Rixeh> <Rixeh> I'm thinking at least: Walk, Run, Crouch, Jumpjet(?), Hit(Upper), Hit(Lower), Shoot, Powerup, Powerdown..
[00:26:01] <Rixeh> <ToxicSoul> Turn!
[00:26:02] <Rixeh> <ToxicSoul> Torsotwise
[00:26:03] <Rixeh> <Rixeh> Twists actually..hmm
[00:26:03] <ToxicSoul> haha go linux!
[00:26:04] <Rixeh> <Rixeh> If that's an animation, how do you stop it at 45 degrees, etc? Shouldnt th
[00:26:05] <Rixeh> <Rixeh> er, should the upper/lower torsos be 2 meshes?
[00:26:14] <Gohan> LINUX = FAIL! Finally! Very Happy
[00:26:19] <ToxicSoul> yes they need to be two meshes IMO
[00:26:37] <~Xavier> the exporter will build that based on naming or exporter UI config settings
[00:26:47] <~Xavier> they do not actually need to be wto meshes
[00:26:49] <ToxicSoul> I like MW4's model file structure
[00:26:50] <Rixeh> GOOD.
[00:26:52] <Thoth> never, no linux fail... unless you are one of our customers refusing to upgrade from redhat 72
[00:26:53] <ToxicSoul> really?
[00:26:53] <ToxicSoul> 0.o
[00:27:03] <ToxicSoul> How do you do torso twist then/
[00:27:10] <~Xavier> we can grab the spine bone that the top half is connected to and rotate that
[00:27:18] <ToxicSoul> Won't that distort it?
[00:27:22] <~Xavier> no
[00:27:22] <ToxicSoul> say how skin streches?
[00:27:33] <ToxicSoul> (mind you 3d is not my area =p)
[00:27:34] <~Xavier> each vertex is mapped to one bone
[00:27:36] <Rixeh> Xavier, you can manually rotate skeletons?
[00:27:39] <~Xavier> yes
[00:27:42] <Rixeh> rock
[00:27:46] <Rixeh> That's easy then Smile
[00:27:49] <ToxicSoul> alright if you say so then okay =D
[00:27:56] <~Xavier> so we'll have a naming conventi0on for bones and meshes
[00:27:57] <Rixeh> The question is, do skeletons all have to be named the same now too?
[00:28:01] <~Xavier> meshes for hit locations
[00:28:03] <Rixeh> nevermind then. Wink
[00:28:08] <~Xavier> bones for things like rotation and for tag points
[00:28:09] <ToxicSoul> also xav we ever decide on a compression format or just a later date thing
[00:28:30] <Rixeh> Ok, well then consider the hurricane a test model.. we work out all the issues on it first
[00:28:34] <Rixeh> Wink
[00:28:38] <~Xavier> I'd like to use BZ2 but it's slow in codec
[00:29:01] <~Xavier> aye -- we had the Kanazuchi but that's not a CoS model
[00:29:21] <Thoth> sry. i thought that was known
[00:29:30] <ToxicSoul> And I still think initall instal = high compression (.exe that has auto extracting high compressed files) with low compression for things that need to be loaded quickly
[00:30:07] <~Xavier> we'll need to create collision geometry as well -- that also likely will be in the 3D tool and done by the artist -- parametric volumes such as spheres, cylinders, boxes and capsules will probably be sufficient
[00:30:24] <~Xavier> when it's not, the exporter will have to calculate a convex hull for the part in question
[00:30:38] <Rixeh> hmmm
[00:30:49] <~Xavier> np Thoth -- it was nice to have a good looking model to work out other systematic kinks Wink
[00:30:53] <Rixeh> the hitboxes can't be generated according to the mesh?
[00:31:17] <ToxicSoul> spheres/
[00:31:17] <~Xavier> they can but unless we have to use convex hulls I'd rather use parametric volumes
[00:31:24] <ToxicSoul> they can be spheres? =D
[00:31:26] <ToxicSoul> =DDD
[00:31:27] <Rixeh> allright
[00:31:31] <~Xavier> multiples if needed
[00:31:48] <~Xavier> it really depends on performance I guess
[00:31:48] <ToxicSoul> Amazing, would make accurate HOBB so much easier.
[00:32:07] <ToxicSoul> Hmm yeah, well not spheres but non-rectangles
[00:32:12] <~Xavier> we'll try convex hulls first and see if we need to optimize
[00:32:30] <~Xavier> the exporter can create those from the meshes
[00:34:16] <~Xavier> (which means we -- engineering -- need also to get OPCODE integrated with the code
[00:35:01] <~Xavier> OPCODE being an open-source collision detectiojn library that is optimized for trimeshes like convex hulls
[00:35:18] <Sirius> hmm
[00:35:31] <Sirius> hit detection on spheres should be pretty easy really
[00:35:43] <Sirius> distance formula...
[00:35:54] <~Xavier> collision detection on any implicit volume is far simpler than on arbitrary mesh
[00:36:00] <Sirius> true
[00:36:07] <~Xavier> that's why I'd rather use it if possible
[00:36:31] <~Xavier> for fighters they mostly use capsules -- two guys fighting don't beenfit much from pinpoint collision detection
[00:36:48] <~Xavier> for our needs I have a feeling that we'll need to do trimesh as much as I'd like not to
[00:37:45] <~Xavier> with dual-core processors becoming more common tho I'm betting that the additional computational complexity may largely be mitigated by the time we have a full release
[00:38:10] <Sirius> even I might have dual-core within a year or two
[00:38:28] <Sirius> probably closer to two... depending how long they keep making socket 939s
[00:38:35] <~Xavier> I'm not sure that AMD or Intel even offer single-core CPUs anymore do they?
[00:38:38] <Sirius> they do
[00:38:40] <~Xavier> k
[00:38:41] <Sirius> I've checked
[00:38:45] <Sirius> ...but they're a bit rarer
[00:38:51] <Sirius> and dirt cheap of course
[00:38:54] <Sirius> in comparison...
[00:39:14] <~Xavier> hehe my next upgrade I might have to get a dual core and *gasp* a PCX mobo
[00:39:19] <Sirius> lol
[00:39:21] <Rixeh> hehe
[00:39:28] *** Gohan quit (Quit: oh god, 24 is on, why am I still on the internets, bad, gohan, bad bad bad)
[00:39:32] <Sirius> there are still AGP motherboards around
[00:39:38] <Rixeh> but the thing is not everyone has dual-cores.. theyre still relatively new-ish
[00:39:45] <Rixeh> some people dont upgrade for years Wink
[00:39:52] <Sirius> I don't have one, obviously, and I upgraded in late Feb
[00:39:53] <~Xavier> I have a hard time justifying it tho, when this 3.0 1GB 6800GT machine here still works like a champ
[00:40:05] <Rixeh> hell i still have an ati 9800 pro agp videocard.. =\
[00:40:05] <Sirius> I considered it... but it wasn't worth it at that stage
[00:40:10] <~Xavier> agreed -- I'm on my third year for this 3.0 I think
[00:40:27] <Thoth> ok, sketch up is pretty awesome
[00:40:31] <~Xavier> lol
[00:40:44] <Thoth> im rusty , give me a break Razz
[00:40:45] <Sirius> 9800s have been around for a long time now, and they're still respectable
[00:40:54] <~Xavier> once I figure out how to get our buildings and environmentals into it it should be the bomb
[00:40:57] <~Xavier> yup
[00:41:09] <~Xavier> 9800 is SM2.0 and SM2.0 is still more than more games need
[00:41:11] <Sirius> DH's FX5200 or whatever isn't, but then it never was
[00:41:31] <Sirius> it's a case of "wow this card is actually slower than a Ti4200"
[00:41:45] <~Xavier> and Ti4200 is still a good card
[00:41:46] <~Xavier> http://www.ati.com/products/RadeonX1K/demos/toyshop.html
[00:41:52] <Sirius> shader model 3 is out now right?
[00:42:01] <Darkhorse> not good enough for my sexiness
[00:42:21] <~Xavier> that demo is done primarily using SM2.0 capabilities -- very little of it (two effects, I think) use SM3.0 (which is X-series and 6-series and higher)
[00:42:30] <Sirius> (Ti4200 is ok, but doesn't run games newer than two years that well)
[00:42:45] <Sirius> ah
[00:42:54] <~Xavier> actually SM4 is out if you want to live on the bleeding edge with DX10 and Vista betas
[00:42:57] <Sirius> not much that I've heard of uses SM3 though
[00:42:59] <Sirius> LOL
[00:43:00] <~Xavier> nope
[00:43:06] <Sirius> does anything support 4 yet?
[00:43:12] <~Xavier> it's got a lot of goodies, but the old ways are still more than enough
[00:43:17] <~Xavier> not that I know ot
[00:43:20] <~Xavier> very early adopters
[00:43:24] <Sirius> even the 7xxx series?
[00:43:57] <~Xavier> game companies on a 3-years dev cycle maybe, looking out to a 2008 release or something, targeting DX10, they might be using SM4 inhouse but nothing on the market, since it still is in beta
[00:44:04] <~Xavier> 7-series is still SM3
[00:44:09] <Sirius> right
[00:44:13] <~Xavier> it's just a hopped-up 6-series
[00:44:24] <~Xavier> lots more parallelism
[00:44:37] <~Xavier> including dual GPUs on the 7950 GTX
[00:44:46] <Sirius> yeah... don't know when I'll next upgrade... probably once I decide to get Vista or something...
[00:44:55] <Sirius> but until then, 6600GT will last QUITE a long time
[00:44:56] <~Xavier> *if* I get Vista, in my cse
[00:44:59] <~Xavier> oh ya
[00:45:18] <Darkhorse> vista meh.
[00:45:22] <Sirius> was fairly reasonably priced for a graphics card too
[00:45:25] <Darkhorse> don't want halo 2 so no
[00:45:35] <~Xavier> I'd say that CoS will probabyl target SM2, with some 3 features if avaiulable (such as vertex texture fetch for GPU mesh deformation)
[00:45:45] <Sirius> Vista has a couple of things that I might have use for... well, maybe three
[00:45:50] <~Xavier> ya the 6600's always have been even since their intro -- odd
[00:45:59] <Sirius> 1. They say you can run UNIX apps on it
[00:46:11] <Sirius> 2. The calendar thing, because I'm disorganised and probably need it
[00:46:16] <Sirius> 3. Hate to say it, but chess
[00:46:17] <Sirius> Razz
[00:46:24] <~Xavier> lol
[00:46:50] <Sirius> chess is so much better than, like, Hearts or whatever
[00:46:58] <~Xavier> lol
[00:47:12] <~Xavier> ok does anyone have anything else they want to bring up?
[00:47:18] <~Xavier> or should we break for the night?
[00:47:24] <Sirius> hmm
[00:47:40] <Sirius> something more useful, do you expect to have any little jobs for me at some point? Smile
[00:47:49] <Sirius> I don't have time for much lately, sad to say
[00:47:58] <Darkhorse> don't suppose you can do level design?
[00:48:01] <Sirius> ...yeah
[00:48:05] <Sirius> I probably could
[00:48:14] <Sirius> hell, made enough levels for other games
[00:48:43] <~Xavier> if that's something you would be into, that would rock
[00:49:26] <Sirius> Unfortunately the most recent of said games was D3, with its 1999 engine (was nice for its time though!) - but still, most of the rest is just catching up
[00:49:38] <~Xavier> Doom3?
[00:49:42] <Sirius> Descent
[00:49:45] <~Xavier> ahh
[00:49:46] <Sirius> Doom 3, lol, I wish
[00:49:54] <~Xavier> was gonna say... Wink
[00:50:15] <~Xavier> ASmu, do we have any interior levels planned?
[00:50:21] <~Xavier> ever, I mean
[00:50:28] <~Xavier> I know this first one is an exterior
[00:50:31] <Sirius> interior levels can be fun
[00:50:38] <Sirius> ESPECIALLY when you have to make ASFs work in them
[00:50:41] <Sirius> Wink
[00:50:42] <Thoth> k, gnight/day all
[00:50:47] <~Xavier> niters Thoth
[00:50:51] *** Thoth (Thoth@nbt-CC8E1678.broadspire.com) left ()
[00:50:59] <~Xavier> ASF?
[00:51:09] <Sirius> aerospace fighters
[00:51:12] <~Xavier> lol
[00:51:17] <Sirius> brings Star Wars to mind... heh
[00:52:11] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> well some maps will have interior and exterior
[00:52:21] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> places for inf and vehicles to fight ion the same map
[00:52:24] <~Xavier> I know the focus is on this first map for the first alpha, but I would like to start filling up the pipeline for future stuff as well
[00:52:33] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> we will also be doing a fight on a space station definatly that would be awesome
[00:52:36] <~Xavier> how about for inf-only levels?
[00:52:39] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> yes
[00:52:41] <~Xavier> xlnt
[00:52:45] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> space station would be inf/MICRO only
[00:52:57] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> and some underground Nisroch ones prob too
[00:54:25] <~Xavier> ok
[00:54:37] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> some urban maps will have significant indoorage too
[00:54:42] <~Xavier> you might want to get familiar with Sketchup then Sirius Wink
[00:54:47] <Sirius> k
[00:55:04] <~Xavier> *sigh* we need a 2D texture specialist
[00:55:17] <Sirius> how does it compare to Truespace for complexity?
[00:55:18] <[HJ]-Asmudius_Heng> i got MS paint!
[00:55:32] <~Xavier> from what I can tell you can import textures into Sketchup and apply them to surfaces -- I could be wrong
[00:55:47] <~Xavier> I haven't used it myself
[00:55:50] <Sirius> hmmm
[00:55:59] <~Xavier> if you have TrueSpace and feel more comfy in that then use TS
[00:56:02] <DarkPhoenix> I'm trying to get Cutter interested in this project, as he has various texturing skills.
[00:56:05] <Sirius> well
[00:56:14] <Sirius> truespace could be crippled in comparison, I don't know
[00:56:21] *** Xavier quit (Connection reset by peer)

[00:59:17] <~Xavier> lol that time it was my CD ripper
[00:59:54] <Darkhorse> cutter's jobs on the MP3 mechs were less than impressive really.
[01:01:03] <DarkPhoenix> hey may have potential though. <shrug> just an idea
[01:02:37] <~Xavier> talking about texturing?
[01:02:52] <Sirius> yeah
[01:05:43] <~Xavier> so Sirius and Asmu should get together on some mockups of any of the interior levels, correct?
[01:06:49] <~Xavier> Toxic needs access to CoS site to be able to work on it
[01:07:13] <ToxicSoul> DP helped out with that already
[01:07:16] <~Xavier> SG is working on scripting while I am working on tools -- I'll get with Slit later on what he should be doing
[01:07:33] <~Xavier> and artists should finish up (or come as close to it as possible) what they are working on by the 15th
[01:07:56] <~Xavier> and designers keep on designing -- and start playing with Sketchup a bit
[01:08:14] <~Xavier> I'll play with it too and see if I can get our content into it sufficiently easily
[01:09:06] <~Xavier> I guess that's it then -- before I get back to banging my head on this exporter, anyone have anything else?
[01:09:31] <ToxicSoul> Um no clue
[01:09:45] <ToxicSoul> Nothing I can think of.
[01:09:53] <~Xavier> k with that then I do this:
