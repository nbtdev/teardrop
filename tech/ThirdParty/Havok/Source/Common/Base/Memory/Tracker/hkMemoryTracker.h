/// Note: There is a weakness in C++ when it comes to using typeid - and therefore the Member definitions for 
/// member variables. The problem is typeid(T) == typeid(T&). Normally thats not too important - but if the
/// code is trying to follow through memory it makes a huge difference - a reference is a pointer, if its not a
/// reference then its actually the object!
///
/// On gcc, there is the typeof operator which returns the type of a variable, and with that if the type is 
/// a reference. On visual studio there seems to be no such way of determining type.
/// Determining a variable type is a reference is easy - but there is no way to get the type of the 
/// variable via templates without using const & - and thus not gaining that information.
///
/// The work around is to use the size of the member. If the type referenced is the same size as a reference - then 
/// there remains no way to determine if it is a reference or not.
